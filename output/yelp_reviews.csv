/biz/pera-mediterranean-brasserie-new-york;Pera Mediterranean Brasserie;Turkish,Mediterranean,Middle Eastern;Midtown East, New York;Jan 6, 2024;5;We were here for a Birthday dinner. I absolutely loved that we didn't have to wait for the whole party to arrive before being seated. I also loved how convenient it was to public transportation. Pretty much across from Grand Central.  The decor was beautiful. We were seated at the table partially surrounded by beautiful Wine bottles. The music wasn't too loud and it felt like a location that you can either dress casual or dress to the nines and not feel out of place.  The staff were very nice. From the moment you entered you were greeted. They were patient and attentive to the tables needs. We had 2 toddlers with our party and they didn't seem overwhelmed.  Everything we tried was delicious. Food, Drinks, Dessert and Coffee. Absolutely great experience.;--;--;--
/biz/mesita-rockville-centre-2;Mesita;Mexican,Lounges;Rockville Centre, NY;Dec 22, 2023;4;We had an early lunch and there was a handful of patrons. The ambience was nice. The music wasn't too loud, just the right amount of background sound. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. Seated right away. Service was quick, food was delish, drinks was on point. Every one was courteous and definitely can't wait to visit again.;--;--;--
/biz/yolk-up-queens;Yolk Up;Breakfast & Brunch,Waffles,Burgers;Oakland Gardens, Queens;Aug 6, 2023;4;We visited on a Sunday around noon. We thought it was going to be packed but it had lots of seating and a few people inside. The place was nice and clean and inviting. It also smelt really good. I don't know if it was the waffles or something else but it was so good. The staff was pleasant and helpful.  What we noticed was that everyone else was waiting for their to-go orders. It seems as though that's very common. There were also a lot of deliveries. We were the only ones that were dining in until we were almost done then another group came in to dine.  We placed our orders and it didn't take that long for us to get our meals. We got the chicken and waffles, tenders and fries and I think it's called the Yolk Up Sandwich, we also got an Oreo Milkshake to go. What we didn't expect was the spiciness from the sandwich and the fries. I didn't mind but my daughter kept asking for water every time she would eat the fries and yet she wouldn't let us take them. We enjoyed everything and will definitely eat here again. Also it is only street parking available.;--;--;1
/biz/sugarberry-bakery-rockville-centre;Sugarberry Bakery;Coffee & Tea,Bakeries,Desserts;Rockville Centre, NY;Jun 20, 2023;5;Went out to eat dinner for Father's Day and my husband had requested going out for dessert also. As we were almost done with dinner I searched Yelp for the nearest dessert shop and to our surprise it was only a few stores down which was great. We walked over from towards the back entrance and it looked beautifully set up for some great pictures and just a nice spot to sit outdoors and have some treats and coffee. We decided we would take our treats home for later but get coffee for the ride home. The line was not long. There was seating inside as well. The showcase was not overwhelming but had a really nice selection of treats. We all got what we were craving along with a Cappuccino and a Flat White. My husband and I both enjoyed everything. We have decided this will be our new dessert spot whenever we want to just go out late for dessert and coffee. They are open late and there is lots of parking. I've already passed on the address to my brother in law and a girlfriend of mine that also has a sweet tooth and lives in the general area.;--;--;--
/biz/the-pantry-rockville-centre-4;The Pantry;Breakfast & Brunch,Comfort Food,American;Rockville Centre, NY;Jun 4, 2023;5;Same as usual. Everything was enjoyed by all. Service was great. Every time I visit I try to order something new. I had the egg white omelet. Loved it. Looking forward to my next visit and what I'm going to try next.;--;--;--
/biz/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art-new-york-3;The Metropolitan Museum of Art;Art Museums;Central Park, New York;May 19, 2023;5;Beautiful art and sculptures. We met one of the artists. Great Day all around. You can spend the whole day enjoying this museum.;--;--;--
/biz/shake-shack-westbury-garden-city-2;Shake Shack Westbury;Burgers,Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Garden City, NY;May 14, 2023;5;Decided to try this shake shack for lunch while out shopping. There was no line when we entered which was great. The wait for our food was not horrible and the food was great.;1;1;1
/biz/the-childrens-social-club-rockville-centre;The Children's Social Club;Indoor Playcentre,Cafes,Party & Event Planning;Rockville Centre, NY;Apr 11, 2023;5;My daughter loved the space, she didn't want to leave. Lots to do from riding a pony to sliding into the ball pit and everything in between. I didn't try the coffee, maybe next time but we did get a snack on the way out. They had an assortment of snacks and candy.;--;--;--
/biz/shirley-chisholm-state-park-brooklyn;Shirley Chisholm State Park;Parks;Starret City, Brooklyn;Apr 11, 2023;5;Great place to go for a stroll, bike, fish and just have a nice family time. It's up to you if you want a relaxing stroll or an intense work out with a long walk, run or ride. There are multiple entrances for different routes so you can switch it up to keep it interesting.;--;--;1
/biz/amc-glen-cove-6-glen-cove;AMC Glen Cove 6;Cinema;Glen Cove, NY;Apr 11, 2023;4;Was a nice theater. Parking available, comfortable seating, great location, everyone was very helpful. We had an issue regarding our gift certificates and they went above and beyond to help rectify the problem. Theater was clean. Only downside was the restroom but it's not like they can clean up behind everyone.;--;--;--
/biz/freemans-new-york-3;Freemans;Breakfast & Brunch,Lounges,American;Lower East Side, New York;Mar 26, 2023;4;We visited for a birthday brunch on a Sunday. The only issue we had was parking. I do admit I loved the location being down the alley. It felt like we were heading to a speakeasy.  We were early for our reservation so we sat at the bar and had a drink. Even though the bar area was small it felt cozy. There were two levels to the restaurant. Once our room was ready we were escorted upstairs. Every one we encountered were courteous.  Once our whole party arrived everything moved quickly. The meal was family style which was nice because you got to try a little bit of everything. We were not disappointed, the food was delicious.;--;--;1
/biz/bonefish-grill-rockville-centre;Bonefish Grill;Seafood;Rockville Centre, NY;Mar 26, 2023;5;I have been meaning to write this update for quite a while. I have visited this location about 2/3 times after my last review and it has been great every time.;--;--;--
/biz/the-melting-pot-red-bank-3;The Melting Pot;Fondue;Red Bank, NJ;Mar 26, 2023;4;We were here for a birthday celebration. The place was clean, including the bathroom. Loved that there was full doors on the stalls. Never understood why most bathroom stalls have openings on the sides. Back to dinner, the servers were attentive, patient, nice and informative. Most of the group has never visited this restaurant before so there was quite a bit of questions.  I loved that it was all family style. We had a fun time trying pretty much a little bit of everything. Every one also seemed pretty happy with their drinks. Will definitely visit again.;--;--;--
/biz/small-batch-garden-city;Small Batch;New American,Breakfast & Brunch,Cocktail Bars;Garden City, NY;Mar 6, 2023;5;Visited for Sunday Brunch with my niece. It is located outside of Roosevelt Field Mall so finding nearby parking depends on time of day. They didn't offer valet parking.  We were seated pretty quick when we arrived. The decor was beautiful and clean. The staff was pleasant and patient.  We enjoyed our food and drinks. I had the Wagyu Burger and my niece had the Steak Frites. We drank a Mimosa and an Agave Ginger non alcoholic drink.  For dessert we had the apple crumble and the cookie skillet. We cannot wait to visit again. Looking forward to trying their dinner menu.;1;--;--
/biz/excelsior-child-care-springfield-gardens;Excelsior Child Care;Child Care & Day Care,Preschools;Springfield Gardens, NY;Jan 23, 2023;5;We are so happy that we found this school. My daughter loves going to school and her teachers. Everyone at the school is great. I don't know how they do what they do but I'm amazed at how much she knows for her age. They have trips and activities in the school that teaches them about all different cultures. They are always thinking of new ways to do fun things with and for the kids and their families.;--;--;1
/biz/las-santas-brooklyn-2;Las Santas;Mexican,Cocktail Bars,Breakfast & Brunch;Fort Greene, Brooklyn;Jun 13, 2022;5;1st time visiting this restaurant and the service was great. The food was great. The vibe was great.;2;2;1
/biz/seasons-52-garden-city-2;Seasons 52;New American,Wine Bars,Seafood;Garden City, NY;May 22, 2022;4;This was a late Mother's Day Dinner and this restaurant we've always wanted to try and I'm glad we finally made it. Alex was our waiter and Darnel was our server and they were absolutely the best. Everything Alex recommended was delicious. I also have to give praises to the bartender because everyone of our drinks were perfect. I hate the taste of alcohol but those drinks. Omg. I had 4 drinks, something I never do. I originally said this wouldn't be a repeat restaurant because they didn't have 2 things that I love, calamari and tiramisu but once I tasted the pesto and chicken flatbread, it was a game changer. We had the flatbread and crab cake for starters. Followed by the Pork Loin that Alex suggested  and the Steak and Lobster Tail. For dessert we had the cookie and cream and coconut cups. We have now added Seasons 52 to our go to restaurants.;4;2;3
/biz/ni-ramen-lynbrook;Ni Ramen;Ramen,Soup,Tapas/Small Plates;Lynbrook, NY;Mar 7, 2022;5;Enjoyed everything we tried. The staff was pleasant and attentive. The decor was beautiful. Will return again to try more ramen.;2;2;2
/biz/david-burke-prime-mashantucket-2;David Burke Prime;Steakhouses;Mashantucket, CT;Nov 30, 2021;5;Once again an outstanding dinner. After my mom saw my pics from my first visit she requested that I take her some time. This time around I brought my mom, my aunts, my sister and a family friend and of course everyone loved every part of dinner. The staff as always pleasant and attentive and becomes part of the great experience. When they brought the Bacon to the table they all took notice and knew this was going to be a great night. The drinks, the bread, the appetizers, the main course, the dessert and the cotton candy (the closer) was all absolutely delicious. Once again, I can't wait to visit again soon.;3;2;2
/biz/g-spa-and-salon-mashantucket;G Spa & Salon;Day Spas;Mashantucket, CT;Nov 30, 2021;5;We had a massage and then some time in the sauna. Our massage therapists were great. Everyone was very zen after their appointments. Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy all the amenities but we have decided that every time we visit we have to do a whole spa day.;2;2;2
/biz/the-fox-tower-foxwoods-mashantucket;The Fox Tower - Foxwoods;Hotels,Casinos;Mashantucket, CT;Nov 30, 2021;4;Great Staff. Rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Our party had 3 rooms reserved and we requested them all together. I loved that when they realized there was an issue with one of the rooms they offered a very nice solution which really made our day. We can't wait to visit again.;2;2;3
/biz/wildplay-wantagh;WildPlay;Ziplining,Day Camps,Challenge Courses;Wantagh, NY;Nov 30, 2021;4;Staff is great and very knowledgeable. They are also great at motivating you to power through. This was our first time on one of these courses and were really happy we came to this location. The view was great.;1;2;2
/biz/juniors-restaurant-and-bakery-foxwoods-mashantucket;Junior's Restaurant & Bakery - Foxwoods;American;Mashantucket, CT;Nov 30, 2021;3;We were seated very quickly. Our server came over right away to introduce herself and take any drink orders. We were here for breakfast so we all had some kind of coffee. When we received our drinks they all tasted warm. We didn't bother to say anything because they weren't big amounts. Our meal orders came out as requested but that too wasn't hot. We didn't make a big deal of it because we were only visiting for one day and wanted to get the day started. Besides the temperature issue, everything else was nice. Staff was absolutely great. Establishment was clean and comfortable.;1;2;3
/biz/massapequa-perk-massapequa-park;Massapequa Perk;Coffee & Tea,Bagels,Juice Bars & Smoothies;Massapequa Park, NY;Oct 21, 2021;5;I've been here 3 times and every time my latte was made perfectly by someone different each time. They have a lot of options for flavors and they have a small selection of pastries, mostly muffins. 2 out of 3 times there was bagel available. It's a small location but they also have outside seating. There is a couch and 2 chairs and a coffee table, just like the Central Perk in Friends. They also have books available to sit and read. Everyone that I've interacted with has always been pleasant. This is my new go to location when I'm in Massapequa Park.;--;1;1
/biz/carvel-hewlett;Carvel;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Hewlett, NY;Jul 8, 2021;5;This rating is for the wonderful gesture by the employee on July 5th. We went in to get our 2yr old ice cream and I also got a cone for myself. We decided to eat the ice cream in the car in the parking lot before we headed home. Unfortunately her cup fell and my husband went to toss it in the trash which happened to be in front of the carvel and I was going to give her my cone. As my husband was walking back to the car the employee came running out with the same order we had gotten for our daughter. This was very very sweet and kind of the employees that I had to share this experience. Thank you again.;--;--;--
/biz/homewood-suites-by-hilton-stratford-stratford-2;Homewood Suites by Hilton Stratford;Hotels;Stratford, CT;May 8, 2021;3;I liked the location of the hotel. Easy access to the highways and close to gas stations and restaurants.  I requested a non smoking one bedroom suite. Check in was quick and easy. You can also reserve your pool time when checking in. All the staff that I've had interactions with were great with the exception of one, I'll get to that later. I get to the room, it was a nice size. Everything looked clean until later when I was getting ready for the pool and I took my slippers off I noticed all the pet hair that accumulated in my slippers. I do suggest getting the carpets shampooed. Not exactly what you want to find when you're staying with a toddler that drops their snacks while eating and tries to pick it up and still eat it. Also the walls are really thin. At night I could actually hear someone walking to the toilet, peeing and flushing their toilet. Also there are times when the water doesn't get hot enough to take a comfortable shower. I'm guessing it's too many guests showering at the same time. We did enjoy having the pool to ourselves for 30 minutes at a time and I love the fact that you have a kitchenette.  I deducted a second star because of the very last staff member that I interacted with before stepping off the property which almost didn't happen. I really wished it didn't happen. Time to check out, so we packed up the car and drove around to the lobby. I walked in and there was no one at the desk. A woman who I assumed was a staff member that was leaving noticed me standing there as she was walking to the door and asked very pleasantly what I needed. I told her I was checking out and she said all I had to do was leave the key card as she pointed towards the counter. I walked over to the counter and as I was putting the card on the counter I noticed a metal holder with the sign for the key cards. As I dropped the card in the holder and started walking off a woman comes running from the back saying hello and then she said hold on so I stopped. She got to the counter, catches her breath and asks ,how can I help you? I explained I was checking out and I've already dropped the cards in the holder. She then asked for the room number. I answered and then she asked did I have a good stay? I said yes. Then she bent her head down and looked at me as though she was looking from the top of imaginary glasses with a smirk and asked you smoked in the room? Almost like you know between you and me I know you did. I was taken back and looked at her for a second and said no. Her facial expression didn't seem like she believed the answer and she said have a nice day. I walked out stunned and hoped that she asked all the guests that same question in the same accusatory tone. I've stayed in many hotels and have never been asked that before when checking out. It definitely left a bad taste.  I've been going back and forth asking myself if I should write this review but after waking up at 5:30A the next day with that interaction still playing over and over in my head I just had to get it off my chest.;--;--;--
/biz/bjs-restaurant-and-brewhouse-valley-stream;BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse;New American,Breweries;Valley Stream, NY;May 7, 2020;5;I have ordered about three times since the shut down in NYC and everything I've ordered from Burgers to Sweet Potato Fries and Calamari has all been delicious. I love the consistency of great food.;--;--;--
/biz/spring-gardens-jamaican-restaurant-springfield-gardens;Spring Gardens Jamaican Restaurant;Caribbean;Springfield Gardens, NY;Sep 8, 2018;1;This is based on only soup. Just ordered two medium beef and not one piece of beef. It should've been called peas soup. Barely potato and piece of a dumpling in one. Nothing but peas in the second one. The only reason I'm writing this review is because we ordered a large chicken soup and there was not one piece of chicken and a bunch of potato. I let it slide last week but this is just upsetting at this point.;1;3;1
/biz/havana-central-garden-city;Havana Central;Caterers,Cuban,Latin American;Garden City, NY;Jul 30, 2018;5;Took my husband here for his birthday and we both loved it. Everything we ordered was prepared quickly and tasted great. Loved the live music. It has us dancing in our seats. We can't wait to visit again.;2;1;2
/biz/nassau-coliseum-uniondale;Nassau Coliseum;Stadiums & Arenas;Uniondale, NY;Jul 30, 2018;1;Don't understand with so much security for cell phone usage that you don't notice people smoking their E-cigarettes which was very uncomfortable for everyone in the area especially the pregnant woman. The huge clouds of smoke was very visible. I'll try another venue next time I'm going to see a Kevin Hart show or any other show.;1;1;1
/biz/besito-mexican-restaurant-roslyn-roslyn-3;Besito Mexican Restaurant - Roslyn;Mexican,Cocktail Bars;Roslyn, NY;Jun 22, 2018;4;We enjoyed the food, the atmosphere and the staff was very pleasant and attentive. We look forward to visiting again.;--;1;1
/biz/k-rico-steakhouse-new-york;K Rico Steakhouse;Bars,Steakhouses,Venues & Event Spaces;Theater District, New York;Jun 22, 2018;5;We had reservations and half of our party arrived about 15-20 minutes early and they seated them right away. Our server and all the staff was very attentive and pleasant.  Everyone enjoyed their drinks except for the lemonade which was unsweetened, but that's just a personal preference. We had not one complaint from our party of 12 about the appetizers, entree's or dessert. It was all delicious and well prepared.  They also have a beautiful back patio which is quite romantic at night. The restaurant itself is quite cozy and romantic. The music had everyone dancing in their seats while waiting for their meal.  I'm looking forward to visiting again. Maybe for brunch next time.;3;2;2
/biz/caffe-roma-pastry-new-york;Caffe Roma Pastry;Bakeries,Coffee & Tea;Little Italy, New York;May 29, 2018;5;This is a review only from a Tiramisu cake that was ordered for a party. The cake came with a shot of espresso which I poured over the cake. OMG talk about Pastry heaven. The cake was so delicious. Everyone raved about it. Next time we may have to place an order for more than one cake to accommodate the demand.;1;1;2
/biz/river-house-grille-freeport;River House Grille;Seafood,Bars,Delis,Sandwiches;Freeport, NY;May 29, 2018;4;Had an enjoyable time here with some friends. The only reason this wasn't a five star review was because a few times we were unable to find our server and there was a couple of mix ups with the orders. Other than that the food and drinks were really good.  We had the Toasted Coconut Martini, Dirty Martini, Pina Colada, Watermelon Martini, Arnold Palmer, Rum Punch and Long Island Ice Tea for drinks. Lots of Raves on the Rum Punch and Watermelon Martini. Dozen Raw Oysters, Lobster Corn Chowder, Riverhouse Oyster and Fried Calamari as our Starters. For the main course there was Crab Legs, Linguini and Clams, Halibut and Surf and Turf. Everyone was happy with the portions, pretty healthy. We closed out with Cheesecake, Tiramisu and Chocolate Ganache Cake with Coffee and Tea.  Honestly I don't know where they stored all this food but we sure had a good time. It's located near the water and you can watch the boats sail by as you enjoy your meal. There is outdoor seating and even though it is not a huge restaurant it doesn't feel cramped.;1;1;2
/biz/raymonds-montclair;Raymond's;American;Montclair, NJ;May 13, 2018;5;I heard about Raymond's from an old coworker. I was visiting my brother near the Montclair location and decided we would head out to NJ a little earlier to try Raymond's before our visit. We got there pretty early and was seated right away.  When you walk in it seems like a really fun diner. I loved the wall of colorful antique bottles. The staff was friendly and attentive.    I had the matcha latte and farm scramble. There wasn't enough rustic bread, it tasted soooo good. I enjoyed my meal and can't wait till our next visit to NJ so we can make a detour to Raymond's.;--;--;--
/biz/p-f-changs-westbury-4;P.F. Chang's;Chinese,Asian Fusion,Gluten-Free;Westbury, NY;May 13, 2018;4;"I came back today because my husband wanted the ribs even though we didn't enjoy our previous visit. We were very pleased with this visit.  We arrived about 15 minutes before our reservation and was seated within 5 minutes. Our server Carlos came over right away and took our drink order.  We had the Blushing Geisha and Chang's Mai Tai. We both agreed that we preferred the Blushing Geisha. As an appetizer we tried the Tempura Calamari and Vegetable which I really enjoyed. We made a meal by adding the Lobster & Shrimp Rice to the appetizer ribs.  The service was great. The drinks and food came out quick and the food tasted great. We are excited to return again since we used to refer to P.F. Chang's as ""Our Restaurant"" because it was our go to restaurant when we started dating.";--;--;--
/biz/usa-diner-rosedale;USA Diner;Diners;Laurelton, Rosedale;Apr 17, 2018;3;This diner is one of my usual go to Diners. I love their Chicken and Waffles. I usually order from the breakfast menu no matter what time of day I visit. The food is always good. Service at times can be slow but not to the point of walking out. I've been coming here for years and will continue to patronize this Diner.;1;--;1
/biz/houlihans-westbury-2;Houlihan's;Bars,New American;Westbury, NY;Apr 14, 2018;4;Due to my crazy work schedule most places are closed when I get off of work and I always end up at a Diner. Finally I did some research on yelp and realized that Houlihan's stays open late.  We arrived just after 12A and they were only seating in the bar area. We were afraid that the kitchen was already closed because we were hungry. A server came over after a short time with a menu and informed us that it was last call for the kitchen. We were happy and a little nervous because we would eat but would it be rushed.  We put in our drink orders(Lemon Drop Martini and a Pineapple Portrait Martini)right away while we quickly looked through the menu. We decided on Calamari as an appetizer, Onion Soup and Meatloaf with a side of sweet potato fries. Everything was enjoyed besides the Onion Soup and our waiter was very pleasant and patient with us.;2;1;1
/biz/bowlero-melville-melville;Bowlero Melville;Venues & Event Spaces,Eatertainment,Bowling;Melville, NY;Apr 10, 2018;4;Out with the ladies and was looking for somewhere for us to go after brunch and we ended up here. It was clean, not too crowded and the music was great. There was lots of parking and we did not have to wait long to get our shoes and lane. The attendant was very pleasant and when the machine was stuck it was taken care of immediately.  We enjoyed our two games while singing along with the music. At the end of the day it was under $100 for two games for five people along with shoe rentals.;1;--;--
/biz/dominos-pizza-jamaica;Domino's Pizza;Pizza,Chicken Wings,Sandwiches;Rochdale, Jamaica;Mar 14, 2018;5;What a difference a couple of years made. Gave the delivery another try and it was pretty quick. The food was hot and delish. We tried the pasta bowl, chicken wings and cheesy bread. Not one complaint. From now on we will continue to order from this location.;--;--;1
/biz/the-capital-grille-garden-city-3;The Capital Grille;Steakhouses,Seafood,Wine Bars;Garden City, NY;Jan 11, 2018;5;I've driven pass this restaurant many times while visiting Roosevelt Field Mall and other nearby restaurants and now  I've finally gotten the chance to give it a try.  This restaurant was requested by the birthday girl and it was not a disappointment at all.  We made reservations for a Saturday night and we informed the restaurant that we were celebrating a birthday. We were all excited because it was our first visit for everyone. Parking is a bit difficult when the mall is open so Valet parking is a must, and it is free. You can also text the valet five minutes before you're ready to leave and they will text you when it's up front. They also have a coat check. When we arrived we were seated right away even though our whole party was not all there, which I think is great.  The table was decorated and there was a card on the table from the staff which was a nice touch.  The ambience was romantic, warm and inviting. For appetizers we had the Lobster and Crab Cakes and the Pan-fried Calamari. We also had the Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese Salad and the Porcini Mushroom Bisque. For our Entrees we had the Dry Aged Porterhouse Steak and the Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails. For our sides we went with the Soy Glazed Brussels Sprout with Bacon, Sam's Mashed Potatoes and of course the Lobster Mac 'N' Cheese. Last but not least, we left room for dessert and we did not regret that decision. We tried the Capital Grille Cheesecake, Warm Double Chocolate Cake, Warm Fuji Apple Crostata and the birthday girl received a beautiful platter with a sampler of the Cheesecake and Chocolate Cake.  The service was impeccable from the valet to the waiter. The food was prepared perfectly and received raves from everyone. The birthday girl was very happy and we cannot wait to visit again.;5;1;1
/biz/jue-lan-club-new-york-3;Jue Lan Club;Chinese;Flatiron, New York;Jan 5, 2018;4;Food was delicious.  Environment was cozy and intimate.   Music was lively.  Drinks were flowing.  Was a great experience. Just beware it's pretty pricey but I'll be back again.;--;--;--
/biz/the-farm-on-adderley-brooklyn;The Farm On Adderley;New American,Breakfast & Brunch,Cocktail Bars;Flatbush, Brooklyn;Jan 5, 2018;5;My most recent visit was for my sister's birthday breakfast. And as I expected, she loved it and she's a tough critic. I have now brought one of my girlfriend, my niece, my mom, my husband and now my sister here for their birthday and everyone of them enjoyed the experience and raved about the food. I think this has now became my go to spot for birthday breakfast or brunch and sometimes dinner.  Can't wait for my next visit.;--;--;--
/biz/amc-roosevelt-field-8-garden-city;AMC Roosevelt Field 8;Cinema;Garden City, NY;Jan 5, 2018;5;This is my new go to movie theater. At times parking can be a bit difficult. This time it was a breeze. Purchasing tickets and our food was quick and the employees were pleasant. The seating was pretty comfortable. The only thing that was missing was my blanket. It's like having the comfort of being at home with the movie theater experience. Now the main reason for the five stars was the fact that my husband left his phone in the theater and we didn't realize until we were about 10 minutes away. The theater was already closed when we left but when we tracked the phone and returned to the theater about 20-25mins after we left the security and I believe the manager didn't hesitate to let my husband back in to look for his phone. My husband was able to retrieve his phone and I truly appreciate that they were so willing to help. Huge thank you to them!;--;--;--
/biz/juniors-restaurant-and-bakery-new-york-3;Junior's Restaurant & Bakery;American,Desserts,Breakfast & Brunch;Theater District, New York;Jan 5, 2018;4;We got here at the perfect time. We were looking for a quick bite and to get out of the cold before catching our show. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated right away even though it was pretty busy after checking out 2 other different eateries with a long wait list. We only had an hour so we decided to have tea to warm us up and appetizers to hold us over till after the show. I had fried calamari and my friend had the Thai barbecue ginger wings. They were both perfectly cooked and delicious. The service was great and quick which was perfect. Next time we visit we will give ourselves more time to enjoy the menu including the shakes and the famous cheesecakes.;--;--;--

/biz/kinky-boots-new-york;Kinky Boots;Performing Arts;Midtown West, New York;Sep 22, 2017;5;AMAZING! AMAZING! AMAZING! I saw the show on September 19th 2017 and the cast was absolutely AMAZING. I don't have words to explain the dancing, the singing, the humor and beautiful story.   I must point out that J. Harrison Ghee kept me enthralled from the moment Lola appeared. That voice, the dance and the comedic timing was impeccable. Delaney Westfall also caught my attention with her voice and physical comedy. I cannot wait to see the show again.;1;--;--

We decided to ride over the walkway which was fun and pretty quick.  We entered on the Highland, NY side and there was a souvenir shop and a spot that you can purchase popcorn, ice cream bars, pretzels, water and sodas and our favorite thing which was the apple cider donuts. We brought at the beginning of our ride over the walkway and also on our way back over.  The Poughkeepsie side also had a souvenir shop and a coffee spot.  We didn't go beyond the parking lot on the Poughkeepsie side but the trails do continue on in either direction of the walkway for hikers and bikers to enjoy.  On our drive to the parking area we did notice restaurants or diners for a quick bite after your excursion.  We will be back again to enjoy the trails.;3;--;1
/biz/lake-george-lake-george-3;Lake George;Lakes;Lake George, NY;Sep 12, 2017;5;First trip was end of July and it was packed. Parking was impossible, walking down the sidewalk or along the lake was impossible but the scenery alone was worth it.  This time around we visited the weekend after Labor Day and it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. We biked to the lake from our hotel. Sat and enjoyed the view of the lake and later enjoyed a game of miniature golf.  It's a great place to visit because it has something for everyone. You can bike, hike, lay out on the beach, enjoy water sports, go sightseeing on a boat, visit a museum and there are many food and bar options.  We can't wait for our next visit because there is always more things to try.;1;--;1
/biz/home2-suites-by-hilton-albany-airport-wolf-rd-albany;Home2 Suites by Hilton Albany Wolf Rd;Hotels;Albany, NY;Jul 31, 2017;5;Our stay at this hotel was great. All of our interactions with the staff was pleasant and they were very helpful.  We chose this hotel because it was the best price and it was centrally located for our trip to Lake George and Bash Bish Falls.  The hotel and our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. Even though the room was not huge it didn't feel cramped and it had everything we needed.  There is a lot of restaurants nearby, a mall about 3 or 4 blocks away and a huge park about 1 block from the hotel. We even got to enjoy our dessert sitting at the fire pit outside.  The only real downside was how packed the breakfast area was because it was pretty small area, we chose to eat breakfast elsewhere.  However I will definitely stay here again and recommend this location to friends.;1;--;1

I've been here before when the line is almost out the door. My only disappointment was that my ice cream mix was made before I was able to get around the family ahead of us to pick my mix ins and my waffle cup seemed a bit stale but I still enjoyed my ice cream mixture and my husband enjoyed his shake.;--;--;--

/biz/caesars-atlantic-city-atlantic-city-3;Caesars Atlantic City;Hotels,Casinos;Atlantic City, NJ;Apr 10, 2017;3;This is my second stay at Caesars and I was a bit disappointed. After paying over $400 for one night plus resort fees I'd expect a bit more than a room with paper thin walls, paper thin towels with stains and holes, holes in the carpet and a view of what looks like a fake balcony over the check in area that is covered in dust bunnies. Really disappointing after convincing my husband to stay at this hotel. I will say that every staff member that we interacted with was very pleasant and the beds were comfortable.;--;--;--

/biz/il-fornetto-brooklyn-3;il Fornetto;Italian,Seafood,Cocktail Bars;Brooklyn, NY;Nov 20, 2016;5;We celebrated my sisters birthday at this restaurant. It was the first time for everyone one. We went all out. For drinks we had wine, champagne, shots, coffee and tea.  For appetizers we had the Calamari Fritti, Mozzarella in Carrozza and Long Island Oysters. Our Entrees were the Linguine Vongole, Pollo di Fave, Parmigiana, Penne Fornetto and Salmone. For Dessert we had Vanilla Ice Cream, Warm Chocolate Cake and Tiramisu. We were a party of seven and it was all under $400 Portions were perfect. Food was flavorful. Service was top notch. The atmosphere was relaxing and we just felt like a wonderful night out. I wouldn't change one moment. Everything was great especially the Tiramisu which was the Birthday girls favorite dessert along with myself. It just melted in your mouth. We have already planned on coming back for brunch with the wonderful view and date night for my husband and myself.;--;--;--

We have been trying for almost 6 months to try and cancel these products and they keep charging her account. She is at the point of closing her account because she is on disability and they are constantly withdrawing from her account and causing an overdraft. DO NOT GIVE THIS COMPANY YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION. If you stood by your product you would have better customer service. I've advised her to call one of the networks to try and re-coop the money from this company.;27;1;--

Pera whips up delicious authentic Eastern Mediterranean cuisine. Our company holiday dinner was perfect. The dining room was nicely decorated and the service was wonderful. We had a prefixed menu of items to choose from and everything was chef kiss delicious.  The Mediterranean trio dip served with crispy pita chips were a huge hit! Will definitely be back to try out their everyday menu.;12;1;9
/biz/sultan-cuisine-clifton-2;Sultan Cuisine;Middle Eastern;Clifton, NJ;Nov 10, 2023;4;I've only been to Sultan Cuisine once and it was such a fun time. On occasion in the upstairs lounge they bring in a DJ and belly dancer and let me tell you it's a vibe. The food was decent and the service was great. The biggest downside was parking, the night that I went parking it was impossible to find. We had to circle the block a bit before we found something. Once we got to the restaurant we found to they have valet (insert face palm emoji) we totally did not see it as we drove by time after time LOL. We were with a large group of people and everything we order came out family style so we were able to taste a decent mix of the menu. My favorite was the borek appetizer which I think is a must order, crunchy deliciousness on the outside creamy feta on the inside.;11;1;6
/biz/paisanos-restaurant-rutherford;Paisano's Restaurant;Italian;Rutherford, NJ;Aug 25, 2023;4;My mother and I visited on a summer afternoon, after roaming the streets for what felt like an hour trying to find parking. The ambiance was very nice. The tables actually have space between them, which you don't always get at restaurants. We didn't feel like we were on top of any other parties that were there and we had plenty of room to just have a comfortable meal without feeling crowded. The restaurant from the outside doesn't look so big, but once you step inside you'll see that the restaurant is broken out into two sections and has outdoor seating!  We each ordered a Ceasar Salad and Penne Vodka with breaded chicken cutlets and honestly couldn't get enough. Everything was delicious - to end the meal we ordered a cup of coffee and split a tartufo. The service was great! Everyone was super friendly and attentive to any and all questions, all of our food came out in a timely manner, and our waiter was very personable. We will definitely be back!;8;1;6
/biz/linwood-pizza-fort-lee;Linwood Pizza;Pizza,Salad,Italian;Fort Lee, NJ;Jun 10, 2023;4;When I used to live in the area - Linwood Pizza was one of my go to pizza shops! Located in Linwood Plaza next to Starbucks. If you go to Linwood Plaza for Hmart or CVS you'll find Linwood Pizza right in-between the two. If you're like me you may go to Hmart to do your weekly grocery shopping. Personally, after all that shopping I usually end up hungry or peckish. Which is where Linwood Pizza comes into play - a slice to fuel me up for the rest of the day? What could be better? Maybe some wings or mozzarella sticks for good measure LOL. They have tasty selections of specialty pies, pastas, and chicken wings. Service is friendly and fast.;8;2;9
/biz/cafe-archetypus-edgewater-2;Cafe Archetypus;Coffee & Tea,Burgers,Wraps;Edgewater, NJ;Apr 14, 2023;5;Cafe Archetypus is a tried and true spot for me. I've been visiting this cafe since I was a little one - it was the perfect place to grab a bite after hitting the movie theatre which used to be right across the street.  Over the years they've updated their menu a few times, but to be honest they always hit the spot ESPECIALLY if you're looking for dessert.  If you're not into dim lit restaurants, this place may not be for you. The cafe is relatively dark overall so if you try to use your phone's flashlight people will be staring at you. The aesthetic of this cafe is pretty unique - I've never seen anything like it especially in bergen county.  One thing to note is the service is friendly, but a bit slow. Oddly enough fits the vibe. You're not going to feel rushed here.;11;--;7
/biz/pa-de-thai-restaurant-edgewater;Pa De Thai Restaurant;Thai;Edgewater, NJ;Mar 18, 2023;5;It's Saturday afternoon and my friend asks me if I want to go on a double date later that evening to Pa De Thai Restaurant. Heck yeah I do - I've lived in the area most of my life and somehow I never stepped foot inside of it so of course my interest was peaked. First Impressions: 1) parking is super accessible it's near a free parking lot and if you're lucky you can grab a spot right out from. 2) it's BYOB (who doesn't love a BYOB spot?) 3) Staff was  super friendly Once we arrived, we were seated almost immediately - the restaurant was busy, but not full. To start we ordered the steamed veggie dumplings which were delicious and the fried vegetable spring rolls. Needless to say everyone was quiet as they munched on their apps - a true sign of satisfaction. As our main we ordered (2) of the chicken pad Thai, (1) of the chicken Pad Kee Moaw, and (1) chicken Pad See Ew. Everything came out very tasty. By the time dessert rolled around we were so full. A few tables over from us ordered the banana fritters and now it's all I can think about LOL which means I will be back very soon. The restaurant overall felt super cozy - the perfect place for a date night.;12;4;12
/biz/balade-your-way-new-york-2;Balade - Your Way;Lebanese,Mediterranean,Halal;Midtown West, New York;Mar 13, 2023;3;Popped into Balade - Your Way with a small group of coworkers during a weekday lunch rush. I've been obsessed with Cava for awhile now, and my one coworker swore that Balade your way would win me over. Middle Eastern restaurants/establishments always hits home for me and I actively seek them out so trying this spot out was a no brainer! The aesthetic of the shop is super chic and cozy, its a bit narrow so there is a bit of elbow bumping during rush periods. I ordered the Tavook (chicken) rice bowl with garlic whip, cucumbers, olives, onions, hummus, and feta. The cucumbers were a bit mushy for my taste, you could tell that they were sitting out for awhile and didn't have that expected crunch. The tavook left me with a bit of heart burn, I wanted to love balade your way, but it didn't hit the same for me as it did for others.;9;1;8

Being my first stop, I invited my MOH, my parents,  my aunt, and grandmother - we were a fairly large group which the shop had no problem assisting. My one issue with the seating arrangements was that they were stained/dirty and for the money you're about to dish out on a dress you'd expect a little more of a cleaner seat to sit on. I tried on a handful of beautiful dresses, but couldn't find the ""the one"" if you're looking for a glitz and glam dress this is a great place to try. If you're looking for a more classic understated sateen dress you may have a hard time finding what you need here.";11;1;10
/biz/enjou-chocolat-morristown;Enjou Chocolat;Candy Stores,Chocolatiers & Shops;Morristown, NJ;Feb 20, 2023;3;"For a little shop they have every inch of space covered in fun and cool treats that you can pick up and share with friends and family. They have favors for bridal showers, baby showers, and weddings - let's not forget all the holiday themed creations they have floating about. I thought pricing was a little expensive for favors and even tried to see if they'd provide any sort of discount for buying in ""bulk"" (175+) but they didn't budge.  Instead of walking out with an order of favors, I left with a box of mixed truffles. Amaretto was by far my favorite! I'll def. be back to try more of their selection.";12;1;8

I've tried a handful of their products, as always not everything was a winner but there are others that are now staples in my daily routine. The scents are high quality, calming, and perfect for gifting during the holiday season.;15;6;16
/biz/englewood-diner-englewood-2;Englewood Diner;Diners,Breakfast & Brunch,American;Englewood, NJ;Dec 16, 2022;2;On the way to the dentist with some time to kill I popped into the Englewood Diner. Guys let me tell you I saw the reviews, and I thought meh it's a diner how bad can it be? I should have listened to the warning my fellow Yelpers put out there. I got seated in a booth, under the table there were scraps left from the previous occupant of the booth and the menu that was handed to me - extremely sticky. So right off the bat I was not feeling this place. I ordered a coke and a Caesar Wrap - the coke tasted more like pepsi and the Caesar Wrap was nothing to brag about. It was decent to say the least.;12;6;8
/biz/buddys-jc-jersey-city-2;Buddy's Jc;Breakfast & Brunch,Bars,American;Jersey City, NJ;Dec 11, 2022;4;Visited Buddy's JC with a group of 3 on a Sunday morning. Unfortunately reservations are not a thing here. So the earlier you can get here the better. As always when it comes to JC street parking is your one and only option. We circled the block a few times and found parking about 3 blocks away, nothing crazy so we were happy we wouldn't have to trek it in the cold. When we got inside the place was packed, we waited for about 20 minutes for a table. While we waited we scanned the menu for our potential meals - honestly there are SO MANY good options it was hard to choose.  We ended up ordering the Fruity Pebble Silver $ Pancakes (delicious - who doesn't love a mini pancake right?), the Cinnamon Toast Crunch pancakes (full size - SO GOOD), and the Hungry Buddy. We ended up digging into each plates because with the overwhelming amount of options we NEEDED to try it all.  We will definitely be back to try more goodies from the menu - if you're second guessing the cereal pancakes DON'T. They are so dang good, you won't be disappointed.;17;6;16
/biz/terhune-orchards-princeton;Terhune Orchards;Fruits & Veggies,Farms,Wine Tasting Room;Princeton, NJ;Dec 8, 2022;5;"Terhune Orchards is the true description of family fun for everyone. Plenty for the kiddos to enjoy like a petting zoo, hay rides, corn maze, and what I would compare to a ""fun house"", but what I was shocked and happy to see was that they had a Wine Tasting Room. Pumpkin/Apple picking just got a heck of a lot more fun. In the wine tasting room you can pick up an ordinary glass of wine OR you can try one of their wine slushies both were loved by my group. After a long day of apple/pumpkin picking we stopped by the Farmer's Market to grab a few apple cider donuts to go. Cider donuts here are 10/10 so dang delicious. Pro Tip: Parking is ample, but get here early to get parking close to the entrance. The later you get here the further you'll have to walk to get inside.";12;5;12
/biz/grimaldis-hoboken;Grimaldi's;Pizza,Italian;Hoboken, NJ;Dec 4, 2022;5;My husband and I visited Grimaldi's on a Friday night. We were nervous about the impending wait, but were surprised to find that our wait time was minimal. To be fair it was 6pm not too early not too late - about an hour into our meal we saw the place really start to fill up. We sat in the back close to where the pizza makers were doing their thang. We honestly enjoyed watching them working and guessing which pizza would soon be ours. LOL So you know we ordered a pizza by now, but what did we start with? To start we ordered the Mozzarella cakes with Marinara Sauce & then split a half pepperoni half bacon pie. Everything was DELICIOUS.  The wait staff was extremely kind, but a little slow on followups. Regardless the food spoke for itself - a little wait isn't so bad when cheesy goodness is on the line.;14;4;13
/biz/brasserie-tenafly;Brasserie;French,Breakfast & Brunch,American;Tenafly, NJ;Nov 20, 2022;3;I visited Brasserie on a whim  I was in Tenafly and I let Yelp lead the way to a quick brunch with the hubs. We were lucky enough to find street parking right out front which is always a solid way to start a meal. Once inside we were shocked to find the restaurant fairly empty, we were seated right away (another solid win).  I ordered the Brioche  French Toast which was quite tasty and came with a mix of fruit on top. My husband ordered the American Breakfast (2 eggs any style with a side of crispy breakfast potatoes). Of course we needed a little more savoriness to our meal so we added on a side of bacon (+$3). Overall the meal was average - I may visit this spot again, but not for brunch.;13;4;13

This event was BY FAR was my favorite Yelp Event. A huge Thank you to Sarah for always curating and creating rockstar events. There were SO MANY vendors who participated in this event, you'd almost think it was a paid food festival. There was so much to sample and you best believe I tried every single thing I could. The lines were a bit much, but for good reason. From soft drinks, cocktails, to food, then dessert there was everything you could want and so much more. I love how other then traditional food vendors there were drinks stands like Sparkling ICE and Health-Ade Kombucha both of which are now staples in my fridge. The only downside to the event was parking, but in Jersey City that kind of goes without says LOL. Here's to hoping 2023 will bring us back all together for some amazing events!;9;5;10
/biz/american-bulldog-coffee-roasters-ridgewood;American Bulldog Coffee Roasters;Coffee Roasteries,Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt,Breakfast & Brunch;Ridgewood, NJ;Nov 6, 2022;4;American Bulldog Coffee Roasters is a small-narrow cozy cafe with outdoor seating in the warmer months. The shop is located off the downtown area, closer to the train tracks. I've visited a few times and this place is a great spot to grab a cup of coffee and cookie when you're on the go. Personally, I find the inside a little too tight for catching up with friends. If you do visit during the summer and are lucky enough to find a spot outdoors, then you're in for a treat. Considering the shop isn't on the main drag, foot traffic is much lighter so you don't have to worry about people eyeing you down for your table.  If you're a cookie fan they make the largest cookies - they literally take up the whole plate they're served on. I've had the oatmeal raisin and the lemon cookies both have hit the spot.;14;6;12
/biz/boucherie-union-square-new-york-2;Boucherie Union Square;Steakhouses,French,Cocktail Bars;Gramercy, New York;Oct 29, 2022;4;After a long day of sample sale shopping my husband and I popped into Boucherie Union Square for an early dinner. We had made reservations so the wait was non-existent which is always a win. The aesthetic of Boucherie Union Square is exactly what I'd imagine a Parisian restaurant to look and feel like. Its flawless and really makes you feel like you're having an experience rather then just grabbing a meal. The service in my opinion was lacking - I'm not sure if it was my shopping bags or if I was dressed too casually, but the hostess and the wait staff we're not friendly. Deducting a star for this alone. The food on another hand was superb. We had the Filet Au Poivre and the Steak Frites both which were both amazing. The peppercorn and brandy sauce on the filet au poivre was *insert chef's kiss* I wanted to bottle it up and bring it home with me. Overall I had an amazing experience. I just wish the staff were a bit more hospitable. Will I be back? Maybe, Boucherie has a few other locations that I may scope out before returning.;10;3;11
/biz/cafe-trois-fort-lee;Cafe Trois;Breakfast & Brunch,Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches;Fort Lee, NJ;Oct 12, 2022;5;Growing up in the area I watched this location change owners a few times. Cafe Trois is such an amazing addition to this plaza and I honestly wish it was placed there earlier. Parking is ample so no need to fight over street parking or pay any meter (whoo!). The inside decor is lovely and creates a comforting atemosphere to hang out with friends or family over coffee and baked goods. The team here is very friendly and keeps the place spotless. When you walk in the first thing you'll see is a clear case filled with baked goods. My favorites are the almond croissant and the green tea almond croissant. Cafe Trois is the ONLY place I've ever seen or tried a green tea almond croissant from so they are my go-to whenever the craving hits! If you can pass the baked goods display there is a menu near the cash wrap that you can order off of.  I have yet to make it that far without stocking up on baked goodies. LOL;15;1;11

If alcohol is involved - even better, right? LOL This spot is the only Chevy's chain I've ever visited so I don't have much to compare to here. The place is usually packed to the brim, the food and drinks are delicious and portions are relatively large. My favorites? The chicken tortilla soup and Mexican sampler.;12;6;9

When you step inside the bakery you'll notice that there isn't much room to look around, the building may be large, but the shop itself is quite small.

It's take out only with a huge parking lot for folks to hang around and munch through their ice cream. Their selection of flavors is far from basic, black raspberry soft serve anybody? Why is that flavor not more common, it was absolutely delicious and I wish I could get access to it more frequently. Unfortunately for me I  found Cliff's on a mini road trip, hopefully our paths will cross again!;15;4;11
/biz/nj-taco-festival-augusta;NJ Taco Festival;Festivals;Augusta, NJ;Sep 10, 2022;4;Thank you to Yelp & the NJ Taco Festival for my pair of general admission tickets! Admission was $10 if purchased online or $15 at the door. An ATM was located near the entrance if needed. Speaking of their online presence, while I was on their site I noticed they provided an hourly breakdown of festivities - cocktail making competitions, best dressed chihuahua competition (one of my favs), and of course the luchadores wrestling matches. Parking was a little crazy, but honestly expected. It is a festival after all with hundreds of people piling in. Luckily there were a handful of wonderful workers directing traffic. If you have the chance to Uber in I would highly recommend it.  The festival had a decent amount of food trucks, dessert, and spirits(alcohol) tents. Having visited a few other Festivals in NJ I wish the trucks/booths handed out samples or mini tacos to test taste before you go all in. After the first 3 trucks I was stuffed LOL so I didn't get to try out as many trucks as I would have wanted.;18;6;16

During lunch time they offer ""pairings"" $12.50 for a flatbread and soup or salad combo - sounded perfect to me. I ordered the Chicken Tortilla Soup and the Garlic Pesto Chicken Flat Bread. Both came out piping hot, but so delicious it was worth burning my mouth LOL. The service was friendly and quick. Will definitely be back when I'm in the area and try their other locations out. I saw that they recently opened up a location in Paramus which I need to visit.";16;4;9

There were two things that put us off slightly and they were not weighted enough to take a star away from this establishment 1. Street Parking 2. Right across the street from a cemetery. Now that the cons are out of the way let's dig into the pros. As soon as we popped into the shop we were in love with the funky mix matched pieces of furniture. We took over the large sofa and table on the right hand side which seemed to be a fan favorite as guests came in and out of the shop (sorry not sorry, should have gotten there earlier folks). After we dropped our stuff off at the table we got up to place our order for 1 drip coffee, 1 cappuccino, and 1 tea (the water for the tea comes in a little pot that you get to pour out yourself - so cute) we also ordered a Strawberry Nutella Crepe to share (to die for). From there we popped over to the game section and picked out connect 4. Overall it was such a great time to catch up and enjoy each others company.;14;4;13
/biz/celis-juice-bar-dixie-west-palm-beach;Celis Juice Bar - Dixie;Juice Bars & Smoothies,Acai Bowls,Sandwiches;West Palm Beach, FL;Aug 7, 2022;4;Celis Juice Bar - Dixie is a great little spot to pickup a healthy drink or breakfast on the go. When I visited this spot I ordered the Palm Breezy Smoothie and Avocado Toast.  The Palm Breezy Smoothie was delicious and honestly a reason to return, the avocado toast on the other hand was not really up to par. A thin layer of avocado topped with 2 thick slices of tomato topped with pieces of mozzarella and drizzled with pesto. The amount of tomato was overpowering the amount of avocado which felt like it defeated the purpose of ordering an AVOCADO TOAST or maybe that's just me. Even though the avocado toast didn't really hit the mark for me, I could taste the freshness in everything they prepared. I'll def. pop back in to try different smoothies options.;15;5;13
/biz/grato-west-palm-beach;Grato;Tuscan;West Palm Beach, FL;Aug 5, 2022;5;I popped into Grato right at opening aka 4pm on the dot. Within minutes many other patrons were lining up to get a table or pulling up a seat at the bar - having nestled into a table by myself I knew I was making the right decision. The look/feel of this restaurant is so modern - I loved the high ceilings, chandeliers, and fun artwork they had throughout. The staff was great, super friendly and sociable. I ordered a Margherita Pizza which honestly would have been enough for two to share, but I was starving so you know I gobbled it all up. If I'm ever in the area I'd love to pop back in to try more of their menu.;14;4;12
/biz/bird-and-branch-new-york;Bird & Branch;Coffee & Tea,Desserts;Midtown West, New York;Jul 26, 2022;3;Popped by Bird & Branch for a mid-day coffee during work and wasn't really impressed. I ordered the Signature Almond Macadamia Latte and couldn't really taste the macadamia and didn't really feel that it stood out over a typical almond milk latte. Near my office I'm surrounded by Starbucks and Gregory locations so I wanted to branch out and try something new. Aesthetic-wise this place is cute, but not wow worthy.;14;5;9
/biz/jersey-city-archery-jersey-city;Jersey City Archery;Archery;Jersey City, NJ;Jul 24, 2022;5;Jersey City Archery is such a great time!  When you first pull up to the spot, you may honestly be confused as to where it is you're going and what you're doing there. It looks very residential so I was surprised to find this warehouse style building right in the middle of people's homes.  The reviews are correct, you do need to take an introductory archery class even if you have experience with a bow. Honestly being someone who has their own bow & target set at home I thought it was fun learning the basics all over again with a group of my friends who never touched this stuff before. If I was coming alone that would probably be a different story. For $30 per person, you really can't go wrong.;15;6;11
/biz/ice-cream-by-mike-ridgewood;Ice Cream by Mike;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Ridgewood, NJ;Jul 23, 2022;3;Who doesn't love walking around Ridgewood, am I right? It's a gorgeous town with such a lovely downtown. When I saw the glowing reviews on Yelp for Ice Cream by Mike I grabbed my cousin and told her it was going to be a Ridgewood day. We bummed around town going shop to shop then popped into Ice Cream by Mike for a little afternoon treat. The shop is relatively small with a decent variety of flavors to try out. It's a little pricey for an ice cream shop, but I guess that's what you get when you're in Ridgewood.  I'm not going to lie we took our time test tasting until we found what was right for us. The ice cream flavors overall are not too sweet and the fruit flavors are just ok... To say the least I wasn't too impressed by the flavors they offered, so I ordered a classic chocolate scoop in a cone. It was definitely a nice little treat on a hot summer day, but I most likely won't be back.;10;3;9
/biz/valerie-new-york;Valerie;New American,Cocktail Bars;Midtown West, New York;Jul 19, 2022;4;I had been eyeing Valerie on Yelp for a quite awhile so I grabbed two of my co-workers and decided to swing by after work. When we stepped foot into  Valerie, I knew I made the right choice - the restaurant is gorgeous  it's serving me romance mixed with Great Gatsby. Let me tell you the place was packed, while we waited for our table we grabbed a drink at the bar along with a few oysters. I didn't actually get a chance to try an oyster, but from what I heard they were delicious. All of the drinks being served were so beautifully crafted, so of course I had to try a couple starting with the Citrus gin and tonic then the waiting game. If you love gin, you'll be surprised by  the abundance of options in their drink menu. When we finally got out table we ordered the Shishito peppers, truffle fries, and the beef cheese sticky buns all were cooked to perfection and delicious. Would love to come back for the live music during Sunday brunch.;14;4;12
/biz/the-pasta-shop-denville;The Pasta Shop;Pasta Shops,Italian,Coffee & Tea;Denville, NJ;Jul 18, 2022;4;I decided to drive to The Pasta Shop on a weekend whim, no reservations just a craving for pasta in my belly. When we arrived, we were shocked by the line - we put our name down and decided to walk around the town to kill our hour wait. Denville looks like it hasn't aged it years and honestly it has such charm, unlike many other towns in NJ. Eventually we made our way back to the restaurant and hung around outside for a few more minutes before our name was called. When seated we were popped onto a table for two, a little narrow as always. I like to ORDER food, if you know what I mean? I feel like those tables for two, should really be for one person - like if I order an app, a salad, and a meal that's not really much room on the table and your basic stuffing it to max capacity then looking for things to give up or place elsewhere. (Rant over sorry for that!) We ordered the meatballs and the mozzarella sticks to start - neither disappointed. The cheese pull on the mozzarella sticks were unreal and def. gave us a giggle as we tried to munch through it. As for the meatballs, after they were gobbled up, we dipped our bread into the sauce left behind - DELICIOUS.  As our main we each ordered the rigatoni vodka - the pasta itself was cooked Al Dente (my favorite) and though the pasta itself was perfection I felt like the sauce could have used some more pizzazz.  Overall, we had an amazing time - I forgot to mention it earlier in the review,, but after your hostess begins to lead you into the restaurant you'll see fresh pasta in the makin' and a little section where you can purchase some for your home. This place is def worth a visit!;11;4;9
/biz/yardbird-las-vegas;Yardbird;Southern,New American,Cocktail Bars;The Strip, Las Vegas;Jul 13, 2022;5;Popped into Yardbird after exploring The Strip with some co-workers.  The restaurant is dimly lit and really gives you a modern day southern look and feel. Atmosphere 10/10 Luckily without a reservation we were quickly seated on a huge sofa with two mini tables in front of us - not an ideal seating option, but it did the trick. The food here is mind-blowingly delicious. Like I'm obsessed, I would come back every time I'm in Las Vegas. My table ordered the Fried Chicken (SO GOOD), Blue Plate Special (delicious), skillet cornbread (surprisingly amazing), to name a few. Literally everything we tried was pure perfection.;13;5;13
/biz/the-henry-las-vegas;The Henry;American,Breakfast & Brunch;The Strip, Las Vegas;Jul 10, 2022;4;Located inside of the Cosmopolitan Hotel The Henry is a great spot to grab some breakfast / brunch. Pre-Conference I popped into The Henry with a group of co-workers to get some breaky. The decors was average nothing notably interesting compared to what you can find in Vegas, BUT the food.. the food is something else. I had the French toast with a side of bacon and both had a delicious crispiness to them. I hate when French toast comes soggy with syrup, if you're like me you will NOT be disappointed here. My co-workers had the Eggs Benedict, Breakfast burrito, and Salmon Avocado toast to name a few. Everyone was happy with their dishes - next time we're back in the area we'll for sure pop back into The Henry.;15;4;9
/biz/saray-cuisine-cliffside-park;Saray Cuisine;Turkish,Mediterranean;Cliffside Park, NJ;Jun 25, 2022;4;I lived near Cliffside Park for a majority of my life and I can tell you that the Turkish Food scene there is better then many other towns in Bergen County. Saray Cuisine is fairly new, but location wise they picked up a gem with ACTUAL PARKING. (Sorry I HATE street parking, so anytime someone has a parking lot I have to call it out) My go to at almost any Turkish restaurant is the same - red lentil soup, Coban Salata, Döner, paired with a refreshing Gazoz. I like Saray and the food they create I just wish that they would season their meals more - once a dish lands on my plate whether its at home or in the actual restaurant I need to load it up with salt, black pepper, and some sumac. The establishment has a very clean/minimal Mediterranean aesthetic. I'm not going to lie though, I've taken out more then I have actually eaten inside so I don't feel that I can comment on the service. One good thing that this spot has going for them (other then the parking situation) is that they offer indoor as well as outdoor seating - but as an FYI the outdoor seating is covered. Overall if I'm in the area I do tend to pop in, but if seasoning is a must on your list there are many other great Turkish restaurants to try out in the area.;17;6;13
/biz/frankie-jersey-city;Frankie;Australian,Wine Bars;Jersey City, NJ;Jun 25, 2022;3;I visited Frankie with a small sized group of gal pals for Saturday brunch. The roads were packed and so was the establishment luckily we had a resy. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating, but my review will focus on indoors.  We started with the Housemade Cinnamon Donuts which were to die for. We were honestly shocked by how quickly they left their plate so we had to order a second round to fill everyones cravings - next we ordered the 2x Avocado Toast with a side of bacon (that side of bacon was a serving on its own - they don't skimp out), a brunch burger, and the crab scramble. Everything post  donuts were average and not much to rave about. The aesthetic is a bit quirky and modern - they did a great job with the decor  but I don't go to brunch on just the aesthetic of a spot. I may be back  for those donuts, but there are many other spots in JC that I still need to try out.;12;6;14
/biz/broad-street-diner-keyport;Broad Street Diner;Diners;Keyport, NJ;Jun 20, 2022;5;The Broad Street Diner is a GEM!  My dad and I have been going pier finish since I was a little girl and when Broad Street Diner came on my radar I planned a morning trip with a goal to hit this spot on our way home. My mom heard that we were going to stop by a Diner instead of a bagel shop and decided to tag along as well.  Even though we were there at the crack of dawn, this place was PACKED. To put things into perspective it was a Sunday and the establishment itself isn't large by any means  It's tiny with an old-timey aesthetic. We put our name down on a list and decided to walk around near by since we had some time to kill.  When we were finally seated, we were in awe by the aesthetic, the service, and heck the menu. I ordered the Churro waffle which is deep fried waffle goodness topped with cinnamon sugar sandwiching some delicious vanilla ice cream. It was PURE PERFECTION. I was in heaven and I was not sharing one bite. My dad had the classic Benedict which looked and tasted spot on while my mom was hoping to get a fruit filled crepe, but was sadly disappointed by them not having that as an option. Instead she ordered a dutch apple pancake which she was pretty happy with. Since my first visit, whenever someone mentions Key Port I tell them they NEED to go to the Broad Street Diner - It's well worth it.;12;5;11
/biz/cravings-tapas-bistro-ridgewood;Cravings Tapas Bistro;Tapas Bars,Tapas/Small Plates,Italian;Ridgewood, NJ;Jun 12, 2022;3;Looking at the Yelp reviews then remembering my recent visit. It's like night and day. I'm honestly confused as to why my experience at Cravings Tapas Bistro is so negative compared to my fellow Yelpers. My husband and I popped in on a weekend night with a bottle of wine in tow from a local shop just around the corner. The place was pretty busy, seats were situated pretty close to each other and we were popped in-between two other couples.  We asked the waiter to make a Sangria out of our wine and it was delicious a very nice touch for a BYOB location. To start we ordered a mix of empanadas (Chicken, Philly Cheesesteak, and Ground Beef)  - then a Crispy Mexican Chicken Breast and a Grilled Black Angus Skirt Steak everything was underwhelming. To try and end our night with a bang we ordered the Zeppole Tree which looked much more space then some of the photos I've seen of it on here. Overall we will not be returned. FYI its street parking, but there is a paid lot across the street.;15;3;7
/biz/the-rag-trader-and-bo-peep-cocktail-and-highball-store-new-york;The Ragtrader & Bo Peep Cocktail and Highball Store;Bars,Piano Bars,New American;Midtown West, New York;Jun 10, 2022;4;The Rag Trader & Bo Peep Cocktail and Highball Store is such a great spot to kick back and enjoy some drinks with co-workers after work. If you plan to visit this spot I'd highly recommend making a resy as it tends to fill up quickly. This place has such a dark and vintage aesthetic - its really an ideal place to grab a drink and relax. The service is wonderful, the drinks are strong, and the food is even better.  This spot is truly a gem!;11;2;12
/biz/van-leeuwen-ice-cream-hudson-yards-new-york;Van Leeuwen Ice Cream - Hudson Yards;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Chelsea, New York;May 26, 2022;5;"Van Leeuwen Ice Cream honestly surprised me with their assortment of vegan ice cream options. They were outstanding, extremely creamy, and delicious you would never know you weren't eating the real thing! If you happen to have a friend who's dairy free but you aren't this place will deliver for both of you!  The way this establishment is set up similar to other you'll select your ""holder"" cup or cone, the size you want, and then of course the flavors you want to fill them with. The employees here were super patient allowing me to taste through their different flavors until I decided on the right one.  The brown sugar cookie dough chunk is heavenly a must try. A little $$$ but totally worth it, what else would you expect in NYC?";20;8;19
/biz/taco-taco-south-beach-miami-beach;Taco Taco South Beach;Tacos,Cocktail Bars,Desserts;Miami Beach, FL;May 26, 2022;3;While visiting South beach I stayed at the Redbury Miami Hotel, so almost everyday I had to walk past Taco Taco South Beach. One night on our way out of our hotel we stopped by to get some drinks before we hit the town because we NEEDED to try the place that calls themselves TACO TACO  say it twice because its twice as nice right? We ordered two shots that were complimentary with a yelp checkin (husband and I are both on Yelp) - then we ordered a mojito and margarita and of course if anyone just so happens to mention guacamole, I'm like OKAY YES I'LL TAKE IT! The guacamole, was a not what I expected - It tasted like something I could pick up at the grocery store. Not something freshly made, quite unfortunate but we didn't stop by Taco Taco with food in mind - so no harm no foul. Overall I should have headed the warnings from fellow yelpers about the food. The drinks on the other hand were a strong pour and exactly what we needed. Like many other South Beach locations, during the day and evening you'll have people out front waiving menus in peoples faces = huge turn off for me.;16;6;11
/biz/pizza-bar-collins-ave-miami-beach-2;Pizza Bar Collins Ave;Pizza,Italian;Miami Beach, FL;May 15, 2022;5;SIZE MATTERS.  Best intro right? Well if you pop into Pizza Bar Collins Ave you'll know what I'm talking about. Slices are LARGE here. At first I was skeptical of this location, I passed by it a few times as I strolled through Miami Beach.  When I'm on vacation I typically try to stay away from the things I eat at home and pizza def fits into that bucket. BUT it was lunch time and I was starving after spending hours sitting under the sun at the beach  Pizza bar was a quick walk and a quick eat so I leaned into the Yelp reviews and headed there straight away.  When we entered the pizzeria there was a bit of a line, but it moved fairly quickly and gave me a chance to scan their selection. To be simple we ordered a cheese slice and a pepperoni slice, when we got the actual slices we were shook. The slices were HUGE - luckily my stomach knows no bounds LOL. After that initial visit we popped back in a few times for some late night eats. If you're in the area I'd highly recommend checking this spot out.;22;9;19
/biz/orange-blossom-miami-beach;Orange Blossom;Breakfast & Brunch,Cocktail Bars;Miami Beach, FL;May 9, 2022;5;Based on the rave reviews of Orange Blossom we held this brunch spot out for our last day, knowing we wanted to end our trip with a bang! It's located ever so slightly off the main drag and has a smaller indoor space offering then other breakfast spots we visited. Outdoor patio is a much larger space and has a DJ blasting music. The ambiance whether indoors or outdoors is lovely and vibrant. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating. The food was delicious - my husband had the two eggs any style (fried eggs always fried LOL) while I had the Nutella French toast. We each had a glass of mimosa to pair with our breakfast which was also light on the orange juice which I prefer. Overall we were very happy with our visit and will be back if we are ever in the area again.;17;5;15
/biz/café-prima-pasta-miami-beach-2;Café Prima Pasta;Italian,Wine Bars,Desserts;Miami Beach, FL;Apr 24, 2022;3;While on vacation a craving for pasta strikes so I head to Yelp and am lead to Café Prima Pasta. Guys, I wanted to like it, I really did - most of the reviews are really glowing so I'm not sure what was going on the night I visited. It was a weekend evening and my husband and I popped in without a reservation, so we expected a wait. What we didn't expect was an attitude from the hostess and overall poor service. We were told it would be a 45 minute wait, fine we headed to the bar and grabbed a drink and chatted through the wait. When we returned to the hostess almost 40 minutes later its like she forgot we were waiting for a table. After a little back and forth we were seated in less then 15 minutes. Once seated we were ready to go, we had already browsed the menu and wanted to get our order in as quick as possible so we can begin to chow down. The waiter slowly made his way to us and took our order, once the food came out we didn't see him again until we had to get up and flag him down to ask for our check. If he had visited our table we would have ordered at least one-two more drinks. Food was okay, my husband and I both got the penne vodka with breaded chicken. The sauce was a little more red then I'm used to and had a more pronounced tomato taste and lacked the creaminess I'm used to.  I would have probably given them 4 stars if it had not been for the lack of service throughout our visit. I understand that restaurants get busy, but it's doesn't mean you can flat out forget about your guests.;14;5;10
/biz/ball-and-chain-miami-2;Ball & Chain;Music Venues,Cocktail Bars,Cuban;Little Havana, Miami;Apr 18, 2022;4;I popped into Ball & Chain in the middle of the day and half expected to see live music and dancing based on all the Yelp reviews, sadly that's for the night owls. The vibe of the establishment is amazing, the bartenders are witty and fun to chat with. The drinks were on point and thankfully they didn't have any one waiving menu's in my face as I walked past / into the establishment. My overall experience was great and I would definitely recommend checking them out as a tourist.;17;5;14
/biz/bodega-taqueria-y-tequila-south-beach-miami-beach;Bodega Taqueria y Tequila South Beach;Bars,Tacos;Miami Beach, FL;Apr 10, 2022;5;Bodega Taqueria y Tequila South Beach is such a gem. At first glance it looks like a trendy taco joint, push open an unlabeled door and boom you're inside of a fairly large speakeasy. The speakeasy is filled with different seating options, a pool table, and large bar. (Every time we visited the pool table always had a group of people playing on it, almost wish they had more then one.) On our trip to Miami we visited Bodega a handful of times - in the afternoons to grab some tacos out front and during the evenings to go into the speakeasy. In terms of food, the tacos are freakin delicious  I was obsessed with the short rib taco. What better to pair your tacos with then a frozen margarita on a hot day? The frozen margs were poured into plastic branded cups.  A lot of people throw those away, but I'm the type of person to bring home those branded cups as souvenirs from my trips (weird, oh well - you should see my cup cabinet haha);19;7;17
/biz/mas-cuba-cafe-and-bar-miami-beach;Mas Cuba Cafe & Bar;Cuban,Cocktail Bars;Miami Beach, FL;Apr 5, 2022;4;While on vacation my husband and I wanted something that was off the beaten path sort of speak  the restaurants and bars on Collins ave can get quite packed and loud - not the ideal place to wind down for the night. Mas Cuba Cafe & Bar was walking distance from our hotel - The Redbury South Beach so it was the perfect spot for us.  The establishment is quite small and narrow its situated right next to an apartment complex so when you're sitting off to the left side of the bar your not quite sure if you're on the right property. On the bright side seating is plenty whether you're indoors or outdoors. The ambiance is laid back and very welcoming. You'll be surrounded by vibrant art on the left side of the bar (outdoor seating) and lots of beautiful plants and trees to the right side (indoor seating). The bartenders were quick, witty, and mixed up some strong cocktails.  Overall, I'm happy that we stumbled upon this gem.;18;7;17
/biz/espanola-way-miami-beach-3;Espanola Way;Local Flavor;Miami Beach, FL;Mar 30, 2022;3;"While on vacation in Miami Beach I was lucky enough to walk through Espanola Way a handful of times. The ""way"" is pedestrian only so you don't run into any traffic involving vehicles, although foot traffic is high with the street being filled to the brim with tourists walking around.  After a dinner at Havana 1957 my husband and I decided to walk the whole street to see what other restaurants / shops were around and were saddened to see that Espanola Way is quite a short walk. What we also noticed is Havana 1957 has a prime location in Espanola Way while other establishments further in try to pick tourists off the street to get them inside. While walking around we constantly had menus shoved in our faces which took away from the old-world charm. It is definitely something to see, but I wouldn't go out of my way just to walk Espanola Way. I'd suggest planning a trip to Havana 1957 or other eateries near and then stroll through.";16;8;13
/biz/havana-1957-cuban-cuisine-espanola-way-miami-beach-8;Havana 1957 Cuban Cuisine - Espanola Way;Cuban,Bars,Breakfast & Brunch;Miami Beach, FL;Mar 24, 2022;5;My husband and I had an AMAZING time at Havana 1957 the food delicious, the ambiance amazing, the music creating such a vibe. I can totally see why people rave about this place whether they be fellow Yelpers or locals. This location like many others in Miami Beach has indoor and outdoor seating. We visited around dinner time and were hoping to get away from heat, even at night the outdoors seemed quite toasty.  To start off we ordered a couple of mojitos, my husband was AMAZED to see that they used real sugar cane as a decorative addition to the drink. He rambled on about his childhood and how his grandmother had them growing in her backyard, from that moment I knew he was hooked and we were in for a treat. As an appetizer we ordered the guacamole which was very tasty and fresh. For Entrees we ordered the ropa vieja which hands down was the BEST I've had - very well seasoned without being overly salty. My husband ordered the Churrasco which he was pleased with. We had no more room for desert, but ordered a few more mojitos while we let the food settle in our bellies before we started to walk back to the hotel. All in all, this is a place is amazin recommend my fellow yelpers check out if they're in the area!;18;8;23
/biz/the-social-club-miami-beach;The Social Club;New American,Breakfast & Brunch,Cocktail Bars;Miami Beach, FL;Mar 17, 2022;5;The Social Club had to have been my FAVORITE spot in Miami Beach it's a must visit. My husband and I decided to test it out for brunch before hitting the beach, wrong move or right move? (bloated but happy which is all that matters) We were seated outside - the vibe was right, everyone was well spaced and were able to soak in a few rays before getting sandy. To start we ordered the $35 bottomless brunch mimosas where you get 4 glasses of juice and a glass of Brut (being bottomless all are refillable during your visit). The juice options all tasted very fresh - my favorite being the peach, but my husband got crafty and started to mix multiple flavors at a time into his mimosas.  After a night of drinking usually I would go for the greasiest option possible , but for some reason I was feeling the complete opposite on the day I visited the Social Club. I ordered a stack of pancakes and a side of fruit (not so exciting I know, but very delicious nonetheless) my husband ordered the surfer combo and I have to say all in all the food, the drinks, the service, the ambiance everything hit the nail on its head. I would definitely come back if I was in the area.;19;11;21
/biz/sweet-liberty-drinks-and-supply-company-miami-beach;Sweet Liberty Drinks & Supply Company;Bars,New American,Venues & Event Spaces;Miami Beach, FL;Mar 9, 2022;4;Sweet Liberty Drinks & Supply Company is a short walk from the Roxbury just about 5 minutes or so depending on your stride and pace (I'm about 5 ft and a slow walker unless I'm hungry then I'll kick it into high gear). The atmosphere is fun and dimly lit. They have string lights and neon lights to brighten the scene, but not much other than that. It's a perfect place to grab some drinks and catch up after a long day on the beach. They have music blasting throughout the establishment and enough room for those brave enough to get up and dance. Cocktails are delicious, strong, and sometimes placed in funny cups. Great place to snap a few photos for my fellow foodies out there. Personally, I didn't really enjoy any of the food choices - however they do offer a range of apps, sides, and desserts.;19;7;19
/biz/the-front-porch-cafe-miami-beach;The Front Porch Cafe;Breakfast & Brunch,American,Southern;Miami Beach, FL;Mar 8, 2022;5;- This review is based off a vacation experience | I don't live in the area or visit frequently, but if I did I would come back to the Front Porch Cafe - The Front Porch Cafe is located off of the main strip of restaurants in Miami Beach and gives your a short break from all of the huba-baba if you know what I mean.  My husband and I visited The Front Porch Cafe a few times on our visit  we went there for breakfast and for drinks. The food was on point and the service was quick and attentive. The seating space was quite large and offered up some outdoor seating that's covered and some that is not with the option of also going into an air conditioned space.;18;4;14
/biz/chopt-creative-salad-co-new-york-45;Chopt Creative Salad Co.;Salad,Vegetarian;Theater District, New York;Feb 26, 2022;2;During a typical work day in New York, when lunch rolls around lines start to form no matter where you are. I eyed Chopt for AWHILE trying to decide if their block long waits would be worth it  eventually I decided to brave the cold and wait. The wait was slow and annoyingly long I had basically wasted my whole lunch break WAITING. When you finally step Inside the scene is chaotic - I ordered the chicken tinga bowl with warm grains (next to the salad/bowls they provide a piece of bread if you request it).  Size of the bowl was not an option, you'll end up with a large amount enough for leftovers for the next day which I guess makes sense based on the price. The bowl itself was nothing special, especially when compared to local favorites like sweet greens, little beet, or even cava. Personally will not be returning, but glad I was able to test out the spot.;18;4;13
/biz/rooftop-at-exchange-place-jersey-city-2;Rooftop at Exchange Place;New American,Cocktail Bars;Jersey City, NJ;Feb 21, 2022;3;Visited the Rooftop at Exchange Place with a small group of friends on a Saturday night, the place was SO crowded. It felt almost as if it was pre-covid times where you had to scope out a seat and move on it as quick as possible, while potential other patrons eyed the same spot. *ready, set, RUN* The ambiance of the rooftop is very trendy with a gorgeous view of the city and Hudson I can totally see why the place draws a crowd. On the rooftop there is a narrow long fire pit that separates the outside portion of the lounge in two, to get a seat near it was almost impossible, but my friend and I were eventually able to grab two spots which allowed our dates to hover near by. The line at the bar is quite long, the drinks a bit pricey though made to perfection.;21;8;16
/biz/kung-fu-tea-montclair;Kung Fu Tea;Bubble Tea,Coffee & Tea,Juice Bars & Smoothies;Montclair, NJ;Feb 13, 2022;5;Kung Fu Tea literally never lets me down - whether I'm visiting their Montclair location or their Fort Lee location, the drinks are always on point. This shop is narrow and a bit tiny, but still offers up some board games and seating for those who are interested. The staff here is super friendly and tend to offer up suggestions for those who are unsure of what to get. Which makes the ordering experience easy and convenient for those who are new to this type of experience. Unlike smaller bubble tea shops the options you get here are AMAZING - extensive toppings, like popping bubbles (my FAVORITE), Fig Jelly, or traditional bubbles to name a few. The ability to customize the level of sweetness in your drink (which is HUGE - I hate when I feel like I'm just drinking juice because of how sweet some shops make my bubble tea). Overall would revisit 10/10 and would bring friends.;20;8;20
/biz/grand-vin-hoboken;Grand Vin;Wine Bars,Italian,Cocktail Bars;Hoboken, NJ;Feb 10, 2022;2;Boy o boy was I disappointed with my Grand Vin experience ESPECIALLY after reading all the 4-5 star reviews about this place on Yelp! Let me back up a little and tell you my story, It was a Sunday morning and reservations were made almost two weeks in advance so when you show up you'd expect little to no wait right? RIGHT?! 40 minutes later, we were seated. Though the pictures on Yelp may make this place look pretty large, it's not. The space itself is pretty tight (think small but long) - the decor looks beautiful in the photo's but certainly would look better in dim lighting then in a bright afternoon sun. The staff was beyond rude and honestly did the minimal to check in on us after we placed our orders. We had to actually get up and flag someone down for the check. The best thing about the whole experience was the Wine Flights.;18;8;10
/biz/a-taste-of-greece-river-edge;A Taste of Greece;Greek,Desserts,Sandwiches;River Edge, NJ;Feb 5, 2022;4;"A literal hole in the wall, A Taste of Greece is such a small restaurant but whips up some delicious greek food. During COVID-19 they've switched from dine in to delivery / takeout which makes sense based on the space they have available.  I typically order the American ""Greek Staples"" a greek salad (covered in feta-deliciousness), a gyro platter, and a chicken souvlaki platter (aka chicken kabobs). All well worth it! If you live in the area and have been considering testing this kitchen out, DO IT. You can thank me later.";16;5;9
/biz/the-standard-restaurant-and-lounge-albany;The Standard Restaurant & Lounge;New American,American,Burgers;Albany, NY;Feb 1, 2022;4;When at Crossgates Mall why not treat yourself right? When you've spent a day shopping and trying / lugging around clothes why not end your trip with some good food and drinks.. The interior and vibe really reminds me of a Houlihan's (franchise that's spread throughout NJ if not other states).  My typical go to is the Spicy Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with fries accompanied by a Miller Lite. The hostesses seem less friendly then I like, but I understand when things get busy all eyes are really on them to get people seated. On the other hand the wait staff is amazing - extremely attentive. Portions are good not large, but not small - pretty perfect.;18;5;14
/biz/brueggers-bagels-pittsford-2;Bruegger's Bagels;Bagels,Breakfast & Brunch,Sandwiches;Pittsford, NY;Jan 10, 2022;3;When staying at the Hilton Garden Inn Rochester/Pittsford Bruegger's Bagels is my morning go to. No matter what day of the week it is, this place gets PACKED (whether you're trying to hit the drive through or are actually popping into the store). The bagels at Bruegger's are definitely a huge step up from chains like Dunkin - my favorite is their garlic bagel, which has some good flavoring. Coffee is also much stronger than the watered down stuff you'd get at a Dunkin.;20;6;12
/biz/tom-wahls-eastview-mall-victor-2;Tom Wahl's Eastview Mall;Burgers,Hot Dogs,American;Victor, NY;Jan 2, 2022;5;Are you at the mall right now? Is your stomach complaining about all the shopping and asking you to stop and check in? Tom Wahl's is literally my go to every time I'm in Eastview Mall - side note - I live in NJ and have never seen this franchise other then in Victor, NY. The burgers are large and filling - however if you've had Tom Wahl's and you think the burgers are too big, you can always opt for a Kiddie Burger which is an average size burger and easier to chomp down on. (Similar concept to Five Guys) Other then their delicious burgers, they have some awesome milkshakes and ice cream cones you should definitely try as well!;16;5;12
/biz/elite-check-in-week-tacoria-jersey-city-jersey-city-2;Elite Check-In Week: tacoria Jersey City;Yelp Events;Jersey City, NJ;Dec 30, 2021;5;I love a Yelp event that gives you a +1! After a long morning at Boundless Adventure my husband and I drove down to Jersey City to part take in the Elite Check-In Week @ Tacoria. Sadly parking was a little tough, but that's not too surprising for Jersey City. If you haven't visited the town before you may get a little shocked, however keep in mind Tacoria is a chain and you can visit their Montclair or Paramus location if JC is too out of reach. In Tacoria we were given one entree, one street corn, and one drink each. By the end of the meal we were both stuffed.  Personally, the drinks weren't my favorite - can you really go wrong with a classic can of coke? Oh well. The meal however, was delicious - If you're looking for fast food and want a step up from Chipotle this is it. NY has Dos Toros and NJ has Tacoria. #SOWORTHIT I ordered the Pollo Tinga burrito and my husband ordered the Pollo Tinga Burrito Box (basically a bowl) - each were large portions, so much so that neither of us finished our meal completely. The decor is so different and really is something to see. Thanks Sara & Tacoria for the check in opportunity!;12;5;13
/biz/yelp-hudson-valleys-be-brave-be-brazen-harrison;Yelp Hudson Valley's Be Brave, Be Brazen;Yelp Events;Harrison, NY;Dec 26, 2021;5;The Yelp Hudson Valley's Be Brave, Be Brazen initially scared me, but helped me take a step or rather a leap in the right direction to get over my fear of heights. Luckily this event allowed us to bring a plus one, so I wouldn't be testing my luck alone and I have to say once you've been properly hooked onto a zip-line and your flying through the air there is nothing like it. The crew was very knowledgeable, and very friendly - prior to hitting the course they help you put on all your gear and walk you through demo's of how to use them. Unfortunately throughout the course they are not following you nor available on each platform in case you get a brain fart, but if you peak down from the platform you're standing on there are numerous crew members on the floor ready to help talk you through anything.  Considering my mild fear of heights I started with a Yellow course, one of the least difficult courses as noted by the crew. What do they say? The first step is the hardest? I hooked myself up and with a team of children waiting behind me I stayed at the very edge of where I was supposed to push off  for a few moments. After the screams of children to push forward grew louder I let myself go with a scream. It was amazing - from there I had a slight hesitation throughout the course, but a love was born. Thank you boundless adventures for sharing your park with us elites. And of course thanks again to Kate for securing this opportunity for all of us to enjoy such an intense and fun adventure park.;17;6;18
/biz/boundless-adventures-purchase;Boundless Adventures;Ziplining,Challenge Courses,Team Building Activities;Purchase, NY;Dec 19, 2021;5;Boundless Adventures is SO FUN! The first time I visited was due to a Yelp Event, however from there I just kept coming back and seeking out other zip-lining courses from NJ to Kentucky.  The crew was very knowledgeable, and very friendly - prior to hitting the course they help you put on all your gear and walk you through demo's of how to use them. Unfortunately throughout the course they are not following you nor available on each platform in case you get a brain fart, but if you peak down from the platform you're standing on there are numerous crew members on the floor to help talk you through anything.  Personally I enjoyed the fact that there are different course types, instead of just one. There are 9 courses in total to choose from, including 3 yellow, 3 green, 2 blue, and 1 black course (in order of difficulty). To do the ultimate black, you need to have done a blue, and before a blue, the green. Honestly this is a great spring/summer/early fall outing for friends and families. You should see the amount of diversity in children and adults zipping around! Really a great spot for the whole family.;16;5;15

/biz/jetblue-los-angeles-2;JetBlue;Airlines;Westchester, Los Angeles;May 2, 2023;1;So disappointed checking in my bags with JetBlue today May 2 2022 flight 100 @ LAX airport. I use the JetBlue credit card & Fly them exclusively. I have 3 upcoming trips already booked with JetBlue. I checked in my 2 bags which are free because I use there credit card and booked my flight on there card and the women tells me I could have 1 carry on bag and my laptop bag- no issues. I was caring a pillow that she told me wasn't allowed through TSA because it was considered 3 bags and that I needed to pay $35 for my Cary on bag if I was carrying my pillow. Such nonsense. I travel with a pillow on all my flights with my carry on bag & laptop backpack. Then I asked her what gate number because on my ticket it says N/A and where security was and she just points left and tells me TSA wont let me through security with my 2 bags + pillow and that she would see me soon again when TSA denied me through security for carrying more than 3 items. nasty attitude! I think she was trying to get me to pay $35 for my carry on bag. Junior employee needs customer service training etiquette.;14;3;8

Loved the whole tortilla chips and salsa which are complimentary. Fresh made salsa and a great taco sauce.  Excellent!

/biz/au-rene-theater-fort-lauderdale;Au-Rene Theater;Stadiums & Arenas,Music Venues;Fort Lauderdale, FL;Apr 1, 2023;5;"Excellent Theater for shows. Staff service, all employees I have had interaction with are always polite and courteous. They are happy you are here. Acoustics are great , seats are comfortable, I have had seats in the front middle and top level for shows and stage view is good from all seats in the theater.  The only issue I have are the electronic tickets that are live with the moving toggle. (No screen shot tickets allowed) - in order to enter the show you need to be connected & logged into your account to show your ticket. Cell service coverage inside the theater is poor and the WiFi is not well.  Because of this problem I was let in and walked down to the front row. I had 3 people assist me to the front row. The eye picture in my review was from this night. The curtain came up and I saw fishnet stocking legs and the back of Tina Turner in my face I was so close. I then realized this was not the Big Band of Brothers concert I thought I was at. I had front row for that show. The only issue was It was next door at the Amaturo Theater. I got up and went next door.  Paper tickets with a bar code is recommended.   My last show I attended.  I look forward to many more.  A great Venue!

I had been trying for over a month to secure a bottle of Blanton's for a Christmas gift. Blanton's whiskey is very hard to get right now due to limited distribution and if you can find it, it is often being sold at an inflated price. Fortunately, I stumbled upon wholesale liquors.  I called a handful of times inquiring about their Blanton's inventory and David was helpful , friendly and professional every time we spoke. On the day that their store was to have a few bottles of Blantons I arrived about 30 minutes before they opened. There was already a line of people waiting to enter the store to make their purchases. I was worried I would not be able to purchase a bottle since they had only a few available. A few minutes before they opened,  David opened the door and saw me and asked if I was the ""Blanton's lady?""  we both started laughing. He told me I was definitely getting a bottle that morning. True to his word, once the store opened, one of the employees pulled me to the side, and told me that they had a bottle of Blantons waiting for me at the cash register. I was able to simply walk inside and check out immediately with a bottle of Blanton's that was reasonably and fairly priced . I appreciate their great customer service so much, and I highly recommend! Thank you, David !";1;--;2

During the holidays expect to stand in a very long line. I use the USPS app to schedule package pick up and also to track packages. You can also renew your postal box on the app as well. Basically I try to avoid going into the actual post office, because there can often be a line even outside of the holiday season because it's, a very tiny post office. The employees, however, are usually always very friendly and helpful. If you do need to call the local post office, make sure that you find the 843 number listed on their Yelp profile  and not the 800 one because the latter will route you to a national call center.;1;--;1

/biz/public-storage-charleston-11;Public Storage;Self Storage;West Ashley, Charleston;Dec 20, 2023;3;I have rented a space here for several years. My biggest complaint is that they are constantly increasing the rate. The longer that you have a unit here the more you will pay for that unit.  For a long time this storage facility was a hot mess. There was zero security measures in place. It's very easy to slip inside the gate if you follow behind another vehicle.  Once inside the entry gate the buildings were accessible to anyone without a code at one time and anyone could also get on the elevator to go to any floor. It was extremely unsafe. It took a murder happening on the premises to change all of that. Since the murder, there are security measures in place and codes are required to enter everything now. I am glad that there is finally more safety measures , it is just sad it took a murder for this to happen.;3;--;1

We brought champagne and orange juice and the spa, kindly accommodated us by keeping our drinks, chilled, as well as providing glassware and a chiller, so that we could enjoy cocktails within the coed, relaxation lounge. The women's locker room was well appointed with plenty of lockers , showers, changing areas and restrooms. The couples massage and facial were both excellent, and our service providers were professional, friendly, and well trained.  My only complaint is that the spa also offers workout classes and while I think this is wonderful, the fact that I can hear the classes while I am inside of the relaxation lounge does not help me relax .  The noise from the classes distracts from the peaceful ambience.;3;--;2
/biz/cafe-amalfi-boston;Cafe Amalfi;Coffee & Tea;North End, Boston;Dec 18, 2023;5;Café Amalfi is our go to spot for our breakfast needs when staying at the Battery Wharf hotel. This café is conveniently located near the Battery Wharf Hotel. No need to drive because the café is located just steps away. Keep in mind, while they are very close, they are not formally apart of the hotel and therefore you cannot charge your purchase to your hotel room. It is perfect for your morning coffee or a quick morning breakfast. The service is very fast and the food is fresh. I enjoy the avocado toast, and any of their Panini sandwiches. They also offer lots of fresh baked goods.;3;--;2
/biz/summer-shack-boston-boston-3;Summer Shack - Boston;Seafood,Bars,New American;Boston, MA;Dec 18, 2023;5;We stopped by recently for a quick snack on our walk back to the nearby parking garage. We sat at the bar and ordered Buffalo shrimp, lobster potstickers, and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque was mediocre ,  especially for Boston, and I do not recommend. The buffalo shrimp and lobster potstickers  were both delicious! Our bartender was quick and efficient and kept our plates cleared, and our drinks filled. The ambience is very casual and the atmosphere is very informal. PS : there is a yelp offer for a free dessert if you check in to the Yelp app.;3;--;2
/biz/fright-kingdom-nashua;Fright Kingdom;Haunted Houses;Nashua, NH;Dec 18, 2023;5;"This is great haunt! If you go during peak nights and hours, expect a long line, however, it moves very quickly, and there is entertainment as you progress through the line.  There is a equal balance of both animatronics and live actors. The animatronics are very impressive and the entire experience is incredibly entertaining.  This is a haunt that you can attend without having to worry about the weather because the haunted attractions are all indoor. The food trucks and vendors are outside so these would be the only things affected by adverse weather. If you are trying to decide between going to Fright Kingdom or nearby Haunted Overload, and you don't have time to do both, haunted overload is definitely my favorite however, it is weather contingent because everything is outside. If you have time, do both fright Kingdom and haunted overload, because they are both quite different and amazing in their own ways. We did both in one night .  PS:  one of the retail vendors outside sells horror grab bags. You do not get to see what is inside as it is supposed to be a ""surprise."" do not waste your money on these grab bags! As others have mentioned in their reviews, the items you will receive in the grab bags do not equal the inflated price tag. In my Stranger Things grab bag was several stickers and one Funko pop toy.";4;--;2
/biz/haunted-overload-lee;Haunted Overload;Haunted Houses;Lee, NH;Dec 18, 2023;5;The best haunted attraction I have ever been to. As a haunt enthusiast, we traveled from South Carolina to New Hampshire to visit the much acclaimed haunted overload. Tickets were sold out, but we called and were advised that if we arrived shortly before they opened there would be a few tickets available for sale. Arriving early is the key here because not only can you purchase limited tickets if they are sold out online you also are the first to enter the haunted attraction and you avoid the long lines and wait.   There is plenty of parking and if you don't mind paying $10 you can park very close to the start of the line. Haunted overload is a sensory experience. The attention to detail is impressive. I do not recall seeing any animatronics. The entire attraction is filled with live actors and very detailed props and sets. If you have ever been to Universal Studios, Halloween horror nights , Haunted Overload is much much better!  The fact that all the money raised goes to charity really elevates the overall experience . You can tell the folks behind haunted overload are incredibly passionate about what they do. Keep in mind that the number one rule is no photos or videos once you enter the actual haunt. You can take as many photos and videos as you want leading up to entering the haunt but once you are inside, you are not allowed to. We saw them kick out several parties for violating this rule . Also, keep in mind that this attraction is 100% outdoors. Thus, plan accordingly and check the weather. At the end of the haunt is a photo op, and also a Gift Shop. There are porta potties and they also sell food and snacks. Haunted overload was absolutely worth traveling to, and it is one that I would attend again. 10 stars!! Do not miss Haunted Overload. It is amazing!;1;--;1
/biz/south-carolina-historical-society-charleston;South Carolina Historical Society;Historical Tours;French Quarter, Charleston;Dec 18, 2023;4;The informative museum  is located on Washington Square in downtown. Plan to spend about 30 to 45 minutes here and maybe even longer depending on how fast and how much you choose to read. There is also an informative video. The museum is fairly small and very easy to navigate and it features several galleries that focus on different periods of South Carolina history. There is a predominant focus on Charleston  history as well. There is a Gift Shop that features South Carolina and Charleston themed products . If the museum inspires you, you also have the option to become a member of the South Carolina historical Society.  It's inexpensive and it gives you unlimited access to the museum and other historical sites.;1;--;1
/biz/bostonia-public-house-boston-4;Bostonia Public House;New American,Music Venues,Cocktail Bars;Financial District, Boston;Dec 15, 2023;3;Playing tourist in Boston we worked up an appetite and so we stumbled into the Bostonia public house, conveniently located in the heart of Boston and close to nearby historic attractions.  We sat at the bar and proceeded to order, cocktails, and lunch. I started with the pumpkin pie martini. I do not recommend this martini unless you like very sweet and dessert like cocktails after a few sips I could not drink anymore due to the sweetness . We also ordered the onion dip as an appetizer and this was also very sweet. It tasted as if they added a healthy dose of sugar to the preparation, and it was not a good flavor. I don't recommend. I do recommend the lobster roll and the spicy beef and pork Bolognese. The latter reminded me of childhood dinners of hamburger helper, and A confident, intelligent I was here for it! I actually really enjoyed it. It was a nostalgic lunch for me. The lobster roll was fresh and stuffed to the brim with meat.;3;--;3
/biz/brasserie-la-banque-charleston;Brasserie La Banque;French,Brasseries;French Quarter, Charleston;Dec 15, 2023;5;Stopped by on a Saturday morning for breakfast, while playing tourist in our own city. The service was great and we really enjoyed that the quiche Lorraine as well as the French 75 cocktail.  If you have dinner here, make sure you check out their sister bar downstairs called Bar Vauté. Bar Vauté is the only bar in Charleston that is below sea level.  Parking can be challenging so plan accordingly. There is no valet and it is metered street parking only.  If you are visiting Charleston, the restaurant is conveniently located to popular tourist sites like the provost dungeon, the powder museum, rainbow row, Washington Square, and the South Carolina historical society museum.;1;--;1

/biz/magnolias-charleston;Magnolias;Southern,Wine Bars,Salad;French Quarter, Charleston;Dec 3, 2023;5;We just had an amazing dinner at Magnolias. On this most recent visit , we opted to enjoy dinner at the bar and the service and ambiance was great .   I ordered the halibut special topped with truffle beurre blanc . It was presented atop horseradish infused mashed potatoes and broccolini. I was SHOOKETH how amazing the truffle beurre blanc complimented the halibut. Every bite was more delicious than the last . The texture was perfectly tender and flaky and the flavor profile was just incredible . One of the best fish dishes I've ever had in Charleston !  My boyfriend ordered the Bourbon BBQ Glazed Pork Chop with smoked Gouda mac & cheese, Carolina red rice, braised collard greens. His entree was also very good and flavorful !! Magnolias is considered by most to be a tourist spot but as a Native , Magnolias passes the vibe check .;2;--;1
/biz/the-waterfront-restaurant-edisto-beach;The Waterfront Restaurant;New American,Seafood,Burgers;Edisto Beach, SC;Dec 2, 2023;5;It's a solid place at Edisto Beach .  In the summer months they get very busy and there is often a wait . They operate on a first come , first serve basis with no reservation system or call ahead seating available so keep in mind if time is a concern . In the off season , winter months there's typically no wait .  The food is pretty good : seafood, steaks & sandwiches offered in a casual, nautical-inspired diner. My favorite thing on the menu is the prime rib ! It is tender , flavorful and delicious . The complimentary hush puppies are also very good , with pieces of corn mixed into the cornmeal .  On this most recent visit, I tried the Edisto Mahi : Mahi filet topped with a candied bacon horseradish sauce . The horseradish sauce was good but I felt like the candied bacon was too sweet for the dish and did not compliment the fish well .  If you like fried shrimp , they're good here !  Be prepared to pay the kitty tax upon exiting the restaurant with your to-go box . There's a few cats that wait directly outside the restaurant looking adorable hoping for a treat from exiting diners . Our most recent visit we offered them grilled shrimp pieces and mahi . They graciously accepted . Be nice to the restaurant kitties as the owner looks out for them .  Check out Waterfront if you are in Edisto !;2;--;2
/biz/copps-hill-burying-ground-boston;Copp's Hill Burying Ground;Landmarks & Historical Buildings,Funeral Services & Cemeteries;North End, Boston;Nov 30, 2023;5;"A must visit for any history buff or cemetery enthusiast. Copp's Hill Burying Ground is the final resting place and burying ground of merchants, artisans, and craftspeople who lived in the North End of Boston . Copp's Hill was Boston's largest colonial burying ground, dating from 1659. If you've never seen a colonial New England style headstone , Copp's Hill is full of them .  They are easy to spot because early New England gravestones are made of slate and sandstone and are very thin.   The minimalist decoration and lack of embellishment of the early headstone designs reflect the British Puritan and Anglo-Saxon religious cultures. The morbid imagery on the headstones --such as skulls and crossed bones, winged death's heads, and hourglasses--were designed to remind those left behind of the fleeting nature of life.  I love the funerary art found on these early New England headstones ! I have always enjoyed exploring old cemeteries for the funerary art I am drawn to bold and fun commercial art, and that to me is exactly what gravestones are.  They are signposts advertising who is buried there, and the very old ones have a real flair for it that you will find plenty of in Copp's Hill.  Some notables buried in Copp's Hill are fire-and-brimstone preacher Cotton Mather, a Puritan minister closely associated with the Salem witch trials. The burying ground also holds Old North Church sexton Robert Newman, the man who hung the lanterns on the night of Paul Revere's midnight ride. Also, several participants of the Boston Tea Party are buried here and there graves have a special marker that read , "" Boston tea party participant."" It's a very historical , interesting and peaceful place to spend some time at while visiting Boston.";4;--;3
/biz/roxbury-mercantile-meggett;Roxbury Mercantile;Southern,Seafood,Barbeque;Meggett, SC;Nov 30, 2023;5;I love Roxbury Mercantile. The ambience is rustic and quaint and the food is absolutely delicious. Although it is very busy during the summer months and sometimes on the weekends, the service is always excellent once seated.   My favorite appetizers are the Hot Rox Shrimp : Chili-lime adobo seasoned & sautéed in hot sauce. It's a must try !  I also recommend the Crispy Brussel Sprouts   they're flash fried and tossed in honey sriracha.  My absolute favorite entree here is the Cheshire Heritage Pork Chop : bone-in, sweet tea brined and hickory smoked, finished with Roxbury Gold glaze ....ahhhhmazing !! Just order it ! The restaurant also offers a small Gift Shop area near the restrooms. On my last visit, I picked up a unique book that was both a cookbook and history book of the area. They also sell T-shirts, honey, and other food products.  Check them out! Roxbury Mercantile is worth the drive from Charleston.;3;--;4
/biz/lobby-bar-at-the-sanctuary-hotel-kiawah-island;Lobby Bar at The Sanctuary Hotel;Bars;Kiawah Island, SC;Nov 30, 2023;5;Located in the heart of the sanctuary hotel is the lobby bar.

The fireplace is a great way to warm up on a chilly evening. There is a food menu available and the service is always quick and efficient.

Overlooking the golf course the restaurant offers, scenic views, and a diverse menu. I tried the lobster caviar deviled eggs, the grouper and the farmers plate. Although nothing stood out as spectacularly delicious, the food was good, and the experience was positive, so I would certainly come back to further explore their menu. The dress code is business casual. Expect to see a mixed crowd of diners from golfers , families, date nights to wedding parties. If the weather is cold, there is a beautiful fireplace in the lobby. There is a large parking lot with plenty of free parking.;1;--;2

Stopped by recently after the Bohicket 5K race nearby to celebrate my race finish with a bloody Mary and a quiche Lorraine. The ordering process was quick and informal. We ordered at the counter and chose to set at their bar. The restaurant is clean and quaint.  It seems like a very versatile space, and a place that you could enjoy breakfast lunch or a dinner. They also seem to offer a nice selection of desserts. The quiche Lorraine was very tasty. It was very light and flavorful. I would definitely come here again when I am in the area.;1;--;1
/biz/essex-bar-and-bistro-charlotte;Essex Bar & Bistro;Cocktail Bars,Mediterranean,Tapas/Small Plates;Uptown, Charlotte;Nov 30, 2023;4;They were only able to offer a very limited due to a refrigeration issue, so we really did not get to experience this restaurant too much. In an effort to still support them, we opted to try the charcuterie board and the brussels sprouts salad. The bread that accompanied the charcuterie board was absolutely delicious. I normally refrain from eating bread, however, will make exceptions sometimes . The bread was flavorful and fresh . It paired perfectly with the charcuterie. We were the only ones in the restaurant so the service was quick and efficient. We hope to check them out again when we can explore the menu further.;1;--;1

The food was pretty average . The lobster bisque was bland and not good . The short rib was just okay , not really flavorful at all .  The complimentary bread was the tastiest thing ! The meatball appetizers was tasty . Steak was average .  Our experience may have been skewed because it took forever for our food to be delivered . It took at least 45 minutes for our appetizers and another 45 for entrees . It was just too much delay on a Monday night . There was hardly anyone in the restaurant so not sure what caused such food delays .;2;--;2

/biz/blt-steak-charlotte-4;BLT Steak;Steakhouses,Bars;Uptown, Charlotte;Nov 20, 2023;5;Exceptional service and cuisine.  Located inside the Ritz Carlton, I would dare say one of the best restaurants in Charlotte. On our most recent visit , our server Alex lead us through an amazing dinner with professionalism and charisma.   For your entree , I highly recommend the sautéed Dover sole ! We ordered at the recommendation of our server Alex and were so impressed with this dish ! Fresh , tender and sautéed sole accompanied with a soy caper brown butter - I would say this dish is one of the top three best meals I have had in 2023! I also recommend the lobster Cobb salad . It's a large dish so if you'd like to share with your date , you can let your server know and they will split this salad within two separate bowls .  Don't sleep on the complimentary popovers , they are best enjoyed with pate but the restaurant doesn't always the pate but if they do , get ready for a flavor explosion .  The ambiance is clean , modern and upscale and perfect for a date night or family dinner .  Check them out if you are in Charlotte or staying at the Ritz .;4;1;5
/biz/mare-boston-3;Mare;Seafood,Italian;North End, Boston;Nov 17, 2023;4;Tucked away off the busy and popular Hanover Street is Mare , an upscale and trendy Italian oyster bar.  We dined here on a busy Friday night and they were able to accommodate our party of two without a reservation. Hanover Street can be overwhelming  to visitors due a narrow street , minimal parking and lots of people . Fortunately , Mare has you covered with valet parking.  Our server was excellent . She was friendly and enthusiastic about the menu and offered her recommendations . She did an efficient and excellent job for our table without hovering .  The food was good . We ordered all lobster dishes . They were pretty good . Nothing stood out that would pull me back but it was nice to try.  One of my favorite things was the bread service - it offered 3 different oils and sauces and it was delicious . The bread service was on point . The lobster bisque was good . The Lobster ravioli was just okay - it features smoked bacon and the flavor just did not compliment the lobster meat and accompanying cream sauce . I wouldn't order it again . Definitely , check out Mare if you are on Hanover and interested in seafood.;3;--;3

Cypress Gardens has always been there to host events and support the community.  I have seen it grow and change from when I was a kid and although I'm sad some aspects are no longer there (like the alligator pit) I am grateful this special place has overcome obstacles to continue to thrive today.  Our most recent visit was to the Halloween event that featured a haunted swamp canoe ride and haunted trail and house .  While the props and actors were cheesy , we really enjoyed the event and supporting the park . We liked the storyteller , Bruce Orr and also enjoyed the vendors .  There is plenty of parking and Cypress Gardens often offers free admission to Berkeley County residents on special dates (call to check when the dates are)  . This place is a gem and the Lowcountry is so fortunate to have them !;2;--;1
/biz/bexley-fish-and-raw-bar-summerville;Bexley Fish & Raw Bar;Seafood,Bars;Summerville, SC;Nov 12, 2023;2;Things I liked about Bexley's : Easy parking . You can park on the street or in the free parking garage that's just a few steps away. It's a nice location that overlooks Hutchison Square. You can easily walk to the wine bar on the square for before dinner cocktails or afterwards for a night cap.  Nice, modern ambiance .  Here's what I didn't like : We sat at the food bar and observed that none of the cooks or food workers wear gloves or hair nets. We watched these guys touch every piece of food , touch phones and then go back to touching food . I saw one dude lick a spoon and then place it under the counter. One guy had shoulder length hair and was leaning over plates of food . No hair net and hair not pulled back .  It was all very unhygienic.  Food was just okay.  We ordered 6 different dishes and they all tasted like they had the same spices . Also the gnocchi has sugar in it ! It was too sweet . That's blasphemous. Side note : they also don't serve liquor . Wine only . My partner tried to order some liquor to wash his mouth out of some of the food flavors only to learn the restaurant doesn't have a liquor license .  We had high hopes for Bexley but hopefully the restaurant can get it together .;1;2;--
/biz/ristorante-lidi-daniel-island;Ristorante LIDI;Italian;Daniel Island, Daniel Island;Nov 2, 2023;3;Informal Italian restaurant in the heart of Daniel Island . Upon entering the restaurant,  the red checkered plastic tablecloths set a casual tone . Relaxed , family ambiance . Expect to see folks from all walks of life : kids , families , people just getting off work , dates etc .  In regards to food :  i found everything underwhelming with just  average taste. Everything ordered seemed like it was missing something. We ordered : Stuffed mushrooms appetizer  Meatballs appetizer  Caprese salad Braised veal short rib entree  Piccata entree  The meatballs were the best thing we ordered .  After trying multiple dishes and being disappointed in most of it , this is not a restaurant I'd likely go to again .;2;1;2

The Barony House is a local favorite  and a must visit if you're looking for Southern comfort food in a casual/business casual setting . Ideal for both lunch and dinner . Great for groups or even large parties as the restaurant offers a separate and private dining space.  On this visit we tried: Hamburger steak : topped with an onion gravy . Pretty much as expected , not amazing but good. My partner ate all of it . Green beans : like Grandma makes . Probably some bacon grease , fat back and lard used and it's delicious !  Tomato pie : Presentation was aesthetically pleasing( : presented in a mini tin pie pan. Every bit delicious and flavorful . A must order if it's on the menu . Fried squash : over breaded . Squash is not fresh but frozen according to our server and you could tell in the taste . Wouldn't order again .  Stuffed pork loin : a special of the evening . Overall it was tasty - could have just used a bit more seasoning .  Definitely recommend the Barony House if you're in the Moncks Corner area .;1;--;1

I ordered the buffalo chicken sub in a tub which is basically whatever toppings you'd order for your sub minus the bread and they dump it in a container and that's your meal . Lettuce is usually the best base for this however their lettuce is finely shredded . I tried to eat it with the lettuce but just wasn't feeling it . I ate all the chicken but that's it .  Sub in a tub is a good effort for offering a low carb option but I personally didn't like it and wouldn't order this option again .

/biz/battery-wharf-hotel-boston-waterfront-boston-4;Battery Wharf Hotel, Boston Waterfront;Hotels;North End, Boston;Oct 24, 2023;4;We've stayed here a couple of times . Here's what to know as of October 2023:  You likely won't get a room with a water view . There's multiple buildings that make up the hotel . None of them are truly waterfront . There might be a few rooms with some glimpses of water but highly unlikely you'll get one .  The rooms are a bit dated. We've booked suites on our visits and observed old , dirty carpets , water damage , peeling paint , non functioning features like the bathroom heater . You can tell the furnishings and overall style just needs to be updated.  You may have to walk outside to get to the hotel lobby,  spa , gym or hotel restaurant . The hotel buildings are separate . We had to walk in the employee tunnel to access the spa to avoid walking outside. While you may not think this is a big deal , if it's raining or cold , it matters.  Rooms do not come furnished with a microwave or mini fridge . A mini fridge is available upon request and if one is available.  We bought a bottle of champagne and orange juice to bring to the spa (since they don't offer cocktail service) so we needed to keep our drinks chilled . Luckily the hotel was able to accommodate our request for a mini fridge.  The spa is nice and the gym offers lots of class options if these amenities are important to you. The spa offers a co-ed relaxation lounge if you are wanting to plan a couples spa day. A room key is required to enter your assigned building as well as to utilize the elevator. So make sure everyone has a room key so there's no delays in accessing your room.  Overall it's a nice place to stay however just important to manage expectations so as to maximize your experience here :);1;--;1

/biz/holy-city-brewing-north-charleston;Holy City Brewing;Breweries;North Charleston, SC;Oct 19, 2023;1;"First time visitor to Holy City Brewery. The haunted house by Southern Screams got us there but the poor service ensures we won't be back .  After we did the haunt we sat at the outdoor bar to redeem our beer ticket and order food.  It was two bartenders behind the bar , a male and female . Any questions we asked were met with short , snippy replies . When I attempted to engage with them and compliment the specialty beer crafted specifically for the haunted house they both ignored me . My partner and I were the only ones at the bar and they were both standing around doing nothing and we were literally right in front of them . After 15 seconds of no acknowledgment  , I asked if they'd heard me . ONLY then did the male bartender acknowledge me by saying ""thanks."" Totally weird .  We then ordered food and waited . And waited . And waited . And waited . Right as my partner was initiating canceling the food order and closing the tab , someone brought our food out .  It took almost an HOUR before we received our order . The bartenders never gave us an update on where our food was nor apologize for the delay.  As we were waiting for our food , another couple sat down at the bar . We were surprised that the bartenders were friendly and engaging with them and their food came out before ours .   We have no clue why the bartenders treated us the way they did but they made us feel totally un-welcome.  Because of this , I don't recommend this business and we won't patronize Holy City Brewery again .";2;2;2
/biz/southern-screams-north-charleston;Southern Screams;Haunted Houses;North Charleston, SC;Oct 19, 2023;4;"It's a decent haunt attraction located at Holy City Brewery.  There's 3 tickets options: - general admission $20 - RIP access : includes expedited entry into haunted house , a beer and access to a separate seating area.$35 - Get Buzzed : you get a beer and a burger from Holy City Brewing plus a flash art tattoo from Stardust Tattoo Park Circle plus expedited entry into the haunted house and access to the separate seating area. $155 We did the RIP access.  It was a Wednesday night sooo we later realized we didn't need the RIP access but of course they don't tell you that when you buy the tix .  There was no line and the private seating area was a bit lame so we didn't even sit in there.  I don't really recommend the ""get buzzed"" tour unless you want a tattoo ? Kind of a weird combo  . Anyways , you can order a burger on your own independent of this ticket and not pay $100+ for it .  Do general admission or RIP access.  The haunted attraction itself was pretty good . We had a fun time walking thru it . Took us maybe 10-12 minutes to walk thru . There was a good bit of scare actors and the haunt did not heavily rely on animatronics. My favorite was the possum mask one of the actors was wearing lol . I definitely think this makes for a fun date night or night out with friends .";1;--;2
/biz/pera-mediterranean-brasserie-new-york;Pera Mediterranean Brasserie;Turkish,Mediterranean,Middle Eastern;Midtown East, New York;Oct 17, 2023;5;"From start to finish our experience here was exceptional . Upscale and modern ambiance paired with delicious food has made Pera Mediterranean a must stop on my visits to Manhattan .

/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-3;Los Tacos No.1;Tacos;Theater District, New York;Oct 16, 2023;4;Great little taco spot located off of Times Square . The tacos obviously aren't as good as what you can get in Mexico , but I'd say they're the next best thing. Expect a line but it moves quickly . Reviewing the menu and knowing what you want to order in advance will help keep the line flowing. Also , be ready to tell them whether you want corn or flour tortillas.  We ordered tacos : carne asada , pollo asada , and adobada (marinated pork). We also ordered chips , salsa and guacamole .  Everything was filling and delicious . Service was prompt and quick . Staff efficient and friendly . There's a self serve salsa bar. There aren't tables but there are bars you can stand at and eat . It's a small , bustling spot so do not expect a relaxing meal . Basically , eat & get!  Would recommend and would dine here again .;1;--;2
/biz/la-grande-boucherie-new-york-2;La Grande Boucherie;French,Steakhouses,Cocktail Bars;Theater District, New York;Oct 16, 2023;5;While hanging out in Times Square we decided to find a place that serves one of my favorite desserts that's hard to find in my home city : profiteroles!  Profiteroles are a classic French pastry made out of a dough known as choux. It's a French pastry classic and it's magical.  A quick Yelp search yielded La Grande Boucherie and off we went on our dessert quest . We walked from Times Square to the restaurant which was a less than ten minute walk .  The interior is gorgeous and we were able to easily grab seats at the bar . We quickly ordered what we came for and awaited our sweet treat. Upon arrival , the presentation was beautiful : Choux craquelin, Vanilla ice cream, dark chocolate 66% sauce, and Vanilla Malagasy Chantilly.  Delicious is an understatement . It's worth all the calories , y'all !  The menu looked great and La Grande Boucherie is definitely on my list to visit again the next time I'm in NY.;2;--;1
/biz/florence-county-museum-florence;Florence County Museum;Museums;Florence, SC;Oct 16, 2023;5;Free admission . Closed on Mondays . Large objects are not allowed in the galleries like large bags, parcels, backpacks and umbrellas. Free lockers are available to store large belongings. Mobility accessible with both stairs and an elevator.  My DAR chapter took a field trip to Florence County Museum because of their Revolutionary War gallery . The museum seems fairly new and modern .  It offers two floors of galleries , exhibits and displays . The museum also offers interactive activities for both kids and adults like a museum scavenger hunt and activities in the museum courtyard. On the day we visited I was able to use indigo to dye a small planter and then plant a tomato seed in the planter .  Nice , clean bathrooms and free parking . Plan to spend at least an hour or so here depending on how much you read and any activities you do .;3;--;1

Came in on a slow Sunday and it took a manager more than fifteen minutes to acknowledge our table and ask for our drink order . Took another ten minutes for our actual server to deliver said drinks. Finally ordered appetizers and that took at least 20 minutes to arrive . Once the appetizers arrived we were just extremely disappointed with the service and mediocre food .  We decided to close our check and go to Halls.  Probably wouldn't go here again .;1;1;1
/biz/kid-cashew-mount-pleasant;Kid Cashew;Mediterranean,New American;Mount Pleasant, SC;Oct 16, 2023;4;Decided to give them a try and order some of their vegan options . We tried the beet and arugula salad, stuffed avocado , hummus , brussel sprouts , Greek salad and vegan burger .  Everything was pretty average in taste but the stuffed avocado did stand out as my favorite . Our server was great and he kindly accommodated my request to swap the quinoa that comes with the stuffed avocado for pico de gallo and lettuce . It was very good and I definitely recommend this modification if you don't want quinoa.  Overall, the food was average but I would definitely give this place a shot again . Always appreciate having vegan choices at a restaurant .;2;--;1
/biz/fireside-grille-hurricane;FireSide Grille;American,Salad,Steakhouses;Hurricane, WV;Oct 16, 2023;3;Located right off the interstate in Teays Valley. FireSide Grille offers up a diverse menu in a casual dining atmosphere.  We tried four different appetizers and the best thing was their waffle French fries .  The Buffalo chicken dip , pepperoni rolls ,  fried devil eggs were all mediocre and definitely not worth the calories.  If you are staying at a nearby hotel , perhaps check it out but recognize it's glorified bar food and not that good .;1;--;2

If you wanna get close to these scenic falls it's a short walk over a small wooden bridge and dirt path that will take you right in front of the falls .

Today it's considered a ghost town filled with a few abandoned businesses . The depot is now a national park visitor center .

/biz/new-river-gorge-bridge-fayetteville;New River Gorge Bridge;Landmarks & Historical Buildings;Fayetteville, WV;Oct 15, 2023;5;Steel arch bridge 3,030 feet long over the New River Gorge near Fayetteville, West Virginia, in the Appalachian Mountains. On August 14, 2013, the bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In December 2020, the bridge and the river that runs below the bridge became apart of the New River Gorge national park and preserve. There's multiple ways to catch unique viewpoints of the bridge .  You can hike to different trails to get unobstructed views , you can take a ride down the river itself and flow under the bridge . You can also do the bridge walk : underneath the four lanes of highway 19 and among the rust-red girders and beams is a lesser-known feature of the bridge: a two-foot-wide, grated-steel catwalk that runs the entire length of the bridge. And you can walk it . You just need to book in advance with one of the two outfitters that offer this tour .  Lastly , you can obviously drive over the bridge . Also, once a year, specifically every third Saturday in October, daredevils jump off the bridge during an event called Bridge Day .;1;--;2

/biz/fear-on-the-farm-winfield;Fear On The Farm;Haunted Houses;Winfield, WV;Oct 15, 2023;5;"10/10 recommend! One of the best haunted attractions I've ever been to.  The creativity was a level 10 ! The actors and prosthetics were top notch . It was a totally immersive experience that had lots of scare actors . It took us about 35 minutes to walk through the entire haunted house .  It was quite a sensory overload and you're never quite sure where to look . Loved spotting the cryptkeeper from Tales from the Crypt - the actor even nailed his voice !  Definitely recommend the express pass , it was a long line and we were able to skip past everyone .  Also recommend the add - on experience coffin ride . It's called ""your last ride"" and you get inside a real coffin and it simulates what it's like to take your , um, last ride lol using audio and hydraulics. Also there's a camera inside the coffin so everyone can watch you ! It's so creative and quite an experience !  Highly recommend Fear on the Farm !";1;--;2

Locally owned and the owner and family are so nice !  First time review but not the first time dining here . Every visit has been consistent with top notch service and delicious food.  The restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor dining .  One of my favorite entrees is the short rib and ricotta gnocchi - it's tender marinated short rib  with fresh ricotta cheese gnocchi and topped with shredded Asiago cheese. It's amazing ! I highly recommend this dish .  Our most recent visit we ordered a special : sweet tea marinated fried chicken sandwich and fried zucchini . Both were absolutely delicious ! The zucchini was only lightly battered and it was the best fried zucchini I've ever had . The sweat tea chicken sandwich was crispy and delicious . Love this little gem in downtown Summerville !

/biz/momo-riverfront-park-north-charleston;MOMO Riverfront Park;New American,Seafood,Wine Bars;North Charleston, SC;Oct 15, 2023;3;Great views and great service. We came for Sunday brunch and sat upstairs and enjoyed the open air and beautiful seaside views.   The food itself , however, fell flat for our expectations.  The drinks : Bloody Mary - did not care for it and I think it was the dill flavor vodka that was off-putting . Mimosa flight - it was good but take note , the flight does not come premixed . They bring you a bottle of champagne and mixers and you mix it yourself . It's enough for two people.  Hushpuppies - we ordered because the description said jalapeños so we thought it was going to be a mixture of sweet and spicy . The jalapeños were in the butter but you couldn't taste them at all .  BBQ Hash - consisted of pulled pork, cajun potatoes, 2 fried eggs, avocado hollandaise.  The pulled pork was marinated and drenched in a sweet bbq sauce - the flavors did not blend well and it was not good . My partner did not like the French toast entree he ordered . Neither of us finished anything .  Although I was not impressed with our Brunch food experience , I would give them another try for dinner.;2;--;1

Can't understand how it stays open .  The place was a mess with dirty floors and tables .  They say they sell salsa you can add to your order , they don't . They sell pico de gallo and sauce .  They have terrible customer service . The chips we bought were stale . When I asked to swap them for fresh ones they gave me a new bag of stale chips . I asked the worker if they had tried the stale chips and he quickly replied that he DID NOT ever eat the food there .  Our food was gross - did not finish - did not ask for a refund - we just got out of there fast.  Do yourself a favor and go to Taco Bell , it's ten times better than this dumpster fire . 0/10 do not recommend .;3;1;--

After driving two hours to dine here we arrived about 30 minutes before they closed so I attribute this to why our food wasn't the freshest . Love the quirkiness of this place . It's Yogi Bear everything from the name of the combos - I ordered the ""Boo Boo basket"" to the yogi Bear boxes your order comes in . I love a good themed restaurant . We met a gentleman born and raised in Hartsville who educated us on the history of the restaurant and raved about their food.  He was so authentic and genuine in his love for this Yogi Bear restaurant and shared it was his second visit of the day to the restaurant !  I was a bit disappointed that the chicken breading was not already marinated in honey but that you have to pour honey on it yourself . I believe this is different from how it originally was back in the day .  Either way , we enjoyed our visit and chat with a local fan . Would recommend and I would go back and try again .

/biz/cherrywood-coffeehouse-austin;Cherrywood Coffeehouse;Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch,Beer Bar;Cherrywood, Austin;Sep 23, 2023;4;Cherrywood is such an Austin spot.  You cannot go wrong here.  The only drawback is that parking might require a bit of a walk and parking on the street.  The vibe is very Austin, the beverage selection is great--I. Love their loose tea selections, lots of beers on tap.  Food is way better than most coffee shops/bars.  Can find simple snacks to full meals and everything in between.  An Austin-style all day place from early morning to mid morning to lunch to happy hour to dinner.  Cannot go wrong.  Counter service and food brought to the table.  Mostly bus yourself.

/biz/good-day-café-golden-valley-2;Good Day Café;Breakfast & Brunch,American,Comfort Food;Golden Valley, MN;Sep 23, 2023;3;I have been going to Good Day Cafe since its opening and have always found the friendly staff and simple food to be a great combination for meeting clients and friends.  It is well located at the intersection of I-394 and Hwy 100 for many many people to get to fairly easily.  I have been there for breakfast, snacks, coffee, lunch, happy hour etc.  My most recent visit was a bit of an inflation shock.  At 1: 30 p.m.. there were no sides nor simple snacks.  All of the lunch items were $17+.  Our party of two ordered a side salad with chicken and a Tuna melt with no cheese.  It seems kind of crazy that the bill was $42 With tip for a mid-afternoon snack.  A good spot, well located, ok food, ability to move large crowds of people through, good service but getting pricey for the equation.    It is a large space that works well for their operation. I will continue to visit.  In my opinion a better quality food alternative nearby is Yum!.;--;--;--

/biz/6smith-wayzata-2;6Smith;Seafood,Bars,Burgers;Wayzata, MN;Sep 23, 2023;4;Three of us had a lovely lunch on the deck of 6Smith.  Each of us different protein version of the Ancient Grains Salad--one with chicken, one with salmon and one with shrimp.  It was a lovely fall Minnesota day on the deck and the food was very nice, the service attentive and the ambiance nearly perfect.  It is a nice spot for a client lunch, time with friends but it is quite expensive.  Salads with protein were $18.95 and when you add a protein are in the $28-31 range which is a lot, in my opinion, for a lunch salad.  It was quite tasty, I have to admit.  So I would give five stars for ambiance, 4 stars for food, 4 stars for service, 2.5 stars for value.  Will be back.;1;--;--

/biz/yelp-elite-week-with-dosa-shack-austin;Yelp Elite Week with Dosa Shack;Yelp Events;Rosedale, Austin;Aug 12, 2023;3;In fairness, we went on an evening that was 104 degrees at 6:45 pm, more in their parking lot and waiting area.  The food took a bit longer than most food trucks but we did not anywhere near the wait that some described in their reviews .  No complaints on that. We ordered our food for carry out.  It was packaged carefully.  We ordered devil veggie dosa, paneer tikka, Bombay grilled cheese and mango lassie.  Both the dosa and sandwich were less crispy than would have been ideal and slightly soggy.  We both thought there were just too many different flavors that were competing with one another rather than complimenting.  The mango lassie was the favorite item we tasted.  The paneer tikka was nice--easy to eat, simple, tasty,   The service was polite.  Yelp is grateful for the special opportunity to taste their food.  Thank you.  Wishing you success.;1;--;--
/biz/hilton-anatole-dallas-2;Hilton Anatole;Hotels;Dallas, TX;Aug 5, 2023;4;This hotel was quite the happening place in the early to mid 1980s.  It is not that scene with the beautiful high end restaurants and art.  But Hilton has maintained the property. It is conveniently located next to the design district and is a large property.  The rooms were somewhat updated and nice.  Parking is kind of a cluster--on one lot you needed the key card to get into the parking but not at the exit, at another lot, you needed the key for the exit which is a challenge when you have checked out.  We did not eat at the property and were only there one night so didn't use any of the amenities but the staff seemed attentive and well trained.  I have stayed there a few times since the glory days and they are keeping up with this massive property.  It is not a high end luxury hotel but a definitely nice stay.  Would return.;--;--;--
/biz/flossies-irving;Flossie's;New American,Breakfast & Brunch;Irving, TX;Aug 5, 2023;3;Had breakfast at Flossie's with a friend.  Service was a bit slow but typical for post-pandemic restaurant service.  We ordered off the menu and the had an avocado toast with poached egg and a bowl.  Both were well prepared.  The environment is a bit stark.  Wait staff could use more training.  Probably fine if you are a hotel guest but would not recommend dining here unless you are a captive audience.  It is fine but nothing special.  If you are not a hotel guest the restaurant is easy to find.  there is adjacent abundant parking.   The restaurant is on the lower level of the building.;--;--;--
/biz/monaco-irving;Monaco;Italian,Modern European,Cocktail Bars;Irving, TX;Aug 5, 2023;4;Our party of three had a very nice lunch at Monaco.  It is a bit difficult to find but when we arrived (there is good garage parking behind) we were welcomed.  Service was very attentive.  Our Caesar and Bibb salads for lunch were fresh.  Two of us had to drive back to Austin after lunch so we skipped the meatball specials but they sounded amazing!  This is a great spot if you are in Las Colinas.  It was too hot in August but their patio dining will be lovely in fall and spring.;--;--;--
/biz/aviano-coffee-denver-5;Aviano Coffee;Coffee & Tea;Cherry Creek, Denver;Jul 29, 2023;5;This spot was the vicinity where I needed a meeting so I arranged for it.  The address is a bit difficult to find--it is actually on 2nd.  Once found, it was great.  Busy in mid afternoon, good energy, cool stadium-style seating, polite and cool.  Beverages were tasty and quick--I had green iced tea.  I ordered a garden salad that was nice.  When it is not 100 degrees the sidewalk dining would also be nice!  Great spot in Cherrywood.;1;--;--

/biz/tre-rivali-milwaukee;Tre Rivali;Mediterranean,New American,Bars;Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee;Jun 23, 2023;4;On a lovely summer Thursday evening after a long flight to Milwaukee, we enjoyed a sidewalk cafe dinner of small plates.  We had a Caesar salad, a Mediterranean salad, pulpo grilled octopus and Brussel sprouts.  Our server was friendly, happy, knowledgeable of the menu and area and she had a great sense of timing.  She treated our Pellegrino sparkling water as if it was the finest wine!  The third ward neighborhood is vibrant and fun.  The sidewalk cafe was just right.  Summer in the Midwest can be lovely and tonight it was!;--;--;--

Max the server was smart, cool and knowledgeable of the menu.  The preparations were varied and incredibly prepared.  Really fresh ingredients.  Great flavor.  Good value.  We had Mata Hari, Vegan eggplant, spicy chili wontons, scallion pancakes,.  There were so many other dishes that we wanted to try but got too full.  This was an excellent meal.

We had a great experience.  Knowledgeable and service-oriented server who suggested several fan favorites.  We settled on splitting Anticuchos (Grill Beef Hearts Kebab) and Arroz Chaufa de Mariscos (seafood on rice).  Both were excellent,  Even with two people splitting an appetizer and entree, we had enough leftovers for lunch the following day.   Can't wait to return for Ceviche.  This is a nice change of pace and a great neighborhood spot.  We will be back!  Thank you!;--;--;--

/biz/inn-on-the-alameda-santa-fe;Inn On the Alameda;Hotels;Santa Fe, NM;Jan 6, 2023;5;I stayed at Inn on the Alameda on two different trips in December, 2022.  The holiday decorations were very festive.  I love this spot (which I have stayed at many times prior to December) because of the location, the owner-operator business and the hospitality of the staff.  The hotel has a very Santa Fe style vibe and is very well located--a few blocks from the Plaza in one direction and the Canyon Road Arts District in another.   They are along a creek/Greenbelt that makes for a lovely walk or run.  The breakfast is great, the tequila bar is lively and many of the rooms have patios or balconies which is quite nice with Santa Fe's weather --often cool mornings, hot afternoons and cool/cold night weather.  This is my usual spot to stay if I am not renting a VRBO house.  On my last trip I purchased a painting that was in the lobby--love that they display local artists' works!;--;--;--

Our server was super knowledgeable about the menu and very positive about the establishment and life in general.  Love it when you get positive and happy servers!  He recommended the Carne Guidsada Tacos (that stew meat was very flavorful!) which I had enough for breakfast the next day!  My husband was all set to eat chicken mole enchiladas which were also terrific.  This is a great spot for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner.   For a quick and simple meal stop or a big group.

The menu and the environment is fairly children-friendly.  The Christmas lights and decorations this December were quite festive and is a very nice experience.  Our kids loved it!  The staff was friendly and responsive and fun.  The food is pretty good, nothing special.  I had a broth based Posole soup that quite nice--more like chicken soup with hominy that was a very nice take and a nice break from the typical New Mexican fare (which I love but something simple was nice).  My sister and split the Pear salad from the ""holiday menu"" and that was nice as well.  All in all a great place for groups--people of a variety of ages and food preferences.  A good experience.  I would give it a 3.75 so I will round to a 4.";--;--;--
/biz/marufuku-ramen-austin;Marufuku Ramen;Ramen,Noodles;Austin, TX;Nov 28, 2022;5;This ramen spot in Mueller is a terrific addition to ATX.  It is small with a pleasing decor, counter seating and attentive and friendly front of the house staff.  We have dined at this restaurant four times and have had a great experience with each visit.  We have had the pork (Hakata Tonkotsu)  and chicken ramen (Chicken Paitan), the Marufuku Bites (steamed buns with pork chashu) and the edamame appetizer.  Each dish was well prepared and flavorful.  Portions are large and represent a value--I get two meals out of one order which is about $16.50 at this writing.   We are happy to welcome Marufuku to Austin and specifically to the Mueller neighborhood.;2;--;1

Menus and ordering at tables via QR codes works well.  Payment system is also integrated which is easy.   Their large outdoor yard makes for a great Austin casual all day environment.  On this trip, we brought our two dogs--they have bowls and containers of water for self filling which is great. We had cheeseburger with fries, a farm salad, hummus, an Arnold Palmer and a glass of Malbec.  Everything was very good.   This is a great East Side option.  Parking can be a challenge like many spots!  Will be back again soon!;1;1;1

What a beautiful setting for an event.  The servers were very skilled and polite, our pre-selected meals (I had grilled Salmon) were cooked perfectly.  The restaurant was very careful about food allergies and a team member sought me out at the beginning of the meal to confirm my diary allergy, inquire about other special requirements and assure me that he was aware of the allergy and had communicate that to the chef.  He checked in with me on a couple of occasions to make sure I was doing well.  My dessert was three small sorbet balls instead of other options with dairy.  I will be back.

/biz/tiny-pies-austin-3;Tiny Pies;Desserts;Rosedale, Austin;Nov 7, 2021;5;I have thought about Tiny Pies for many years but haven't ever tried them.  I was searching for a new location for Thanksgiving Pies this year (the last couple of years we used Word of Mouth Bakery but i don't think they are having their Thanksgiving pie package in 2021).  So today (11.07.21) i decided I would try Tiny Pies to see if I wanted to order their for our Thanksgiving.  We got a spinach/feta empanada and four tiny pies--cherry, key lime, apple and Texas two step.   The empanada was excellent.  My husband and I commented on the flakiness of the crust but that in the empanada, it was not too thick except for the decorative seam.  Too many bakeries have too much crust to filling ratio.  We both liked the tiny pie ratio.  We also tried the cherry tiny pie and it was excellent.  We ended up deciding to use Tiny Pies for our Thanksgiving and to send to our son for Thanksgiving in Minnesota and to my folks in New Mexico for their Christmas celebration.  We are pleased and love both their Order and pick up as well as their nationwide delivery.;1;1;1
/biz/buffalo-wild-wings-naperville;Buffalo Wild Wings;Chicken Wings,American,Sports Bars;Naperville, IL;Jan 5, 2024;3;Our family got a takeout order of 10 wings and fries combo for a snack. The food was ready before the 30 minute pick up time but thankfully when we brought it home it was still warm.  We had ordered half Parmesan garlic and half orange chicken. The Parmesan garlic is always a great option and very tasty. The orange chicken though did not have any orange chicken taste instead the chicken was just slathered in Thai chili sauce.  The fries it came with were really well fried and delicious. Wish there was more though since the portion size of wings and fries was pretty small for a $12 order.  Additionally, they only gave one small blue cheese sauce container. Not sure why they were being so stingy with the sauce. Definitely should have given at least two containers. They also didn't provide any napkins in the bag.  All in all, the Parmesan garlic always hits the spot but I was kind of disappointed by how stingy the portion and given items were especially for a chain restaurant.;8;4;7
/biz/edward-hospital-main-campus-naperville;Edward Hospital - Main Campus;Hospitals;Naperville, IL;Jan 4, 2024;3;"I have met a lot of doctors, nurses and care team members in this hospital the pastyear because of my mom's health issues. The care you receive really depends on the day and department but has been positive more often than it has been negative. But that's always how things are in a large hospital.  Our latest visit was for an outpatient procedure. Our main RN couldn't get the IV into my mom's veins twice and had to call another nurse in who thankfully got it in right away. However, when our main RN was struggling she would just throw all of her equipment including the uncapped, used needles of failure all over my mother's bed. After the IV disaster, everything else went smoothly in terms of care except it was awkward because the nurses would talk loudly throughout the whole visit we were sitting in the room about their personal lives and also about us as well. It is always awkward when you hear people talking about you ""behind your back"" especially in a medical setting.   I was happy to see that the department called the day after the visit to follow up and check on how my mom is doing. That was very considerate.  Also, in terms of food, I do need to note that the cafeteria, Riverbend Cafe, is surprisingly great in terms of cost and food quality. :)";10;3;8
/biz/le-chocolat-du-bouchard-naperville;Le Chocolat du Bouchard;Chocolatiers & Shops,Desserts,Bakeries;Naperville, IL;Jan 3, 2024;3;Stopped by around 2 PM on a Wednesday afternoon. There were already two other people waiting to purchase chocolate but no one was around in the store for a good 5 minutes or so to help.  It did take a bit to get through the other two customers which was a bit annoying since I was just hoping to buy one bar of pre packaged chocolate. However, the server was quite friendly.  I also did see that a couple of flies flying on the uncovered chocolates for sale which was a bit unappetizing.  All in all, a cute boutique store that may benefit from one more set of hands behind the counter.;7;4;6
/biz/meatheads-naperville;Meatheads;Burgers,American,Hot Dogs;Naperville, IL;Jan 1, 2024;4;I'm surprised to see all of the low ratings for the restaurant. Since my family lives close by we usually stop here when we want some quick to go burgers and it usually always hits the spot.  Their drive thru is usually not too busy so we end up being one of the only cars whenever we use the service.  We most recently went on New Years Eve around 6 PM and there was literally no one in the drive thru or restaurant. There is only one window for pick up of food and payment and you just wait there for a few minutes after you pay to pick up your food. Service is usually for good with friendly workers.  I ordered an ANGUS BURGER at my most recent visit. Everything worked very well together. The garlic aioli was delicious. And all of the items just came together to make a hearty, delicious burger. The burger was a little bit on the smaller side unfortunately and a bit pricy but the taste and quality of the ingredients helped to make up for it.  We also ordered a side of ORIGINAL FRIES. Fries were hot and well fried. It was a great side to the burger. All in all, a solid fast food burger spot though a bit on the pricier side.;8;4;8

I got a MARKET CHOWDER during my most recent visit and it was delicious.  All in all, though the chowder may be a little bit on the expensive side, it is very tasty and a great little treat.;9;4;9

/biz/peppermill-lounge-aloha;Peppermill Lounge;Sports Bars,American;Aloha, OR;Dec 29, 2023;3;Rating: 3.5 stars  Came here with a group of five on a Friday night. It has the typical neighborhood/dive bar vibes. The bar was pretty crowded because of a UO vs UW game going on in the background and cleared out pretty quickly once the game ended.  Seating is open and you can pick to sit down wherever you want. There are some large booths available which were great to sit at.  Service was a bit on the slower side though because it seemed like they may have been understaffed. The bartender that came over to help us though was friendly.  They also have some pool tables and shooting arcade games in the back that you can pay to play.  My friends decided to grab a round of scooby snack shots which were very tasty and reminded me of being back in college again haha.  All in all, an average bar experience with some small games available as well.;6;5;8
/biz/raising-canes-chicken-fingers-naperville;Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers;Fast Food,Chicken Wings;Naperville, IL;Dec 28, 2023;3;Rating: 3.5 Stars I stopped by here with my dad on a Tuesday night around 5:30 PM to go through the drive thru and the place was packed. The line for the drive thru wrapped around so people were starting to block the regular drivers as well.  Even though there was so many people waiting for the drive thru we were able to order pretty quickly.  The guy taking our order was nice but seemed to have a lot of trouble hearing what I was saying so I ended up repeating myself often since most of the order he repeated back was wrong haha.  Afterwards, everyone else serving the customers in the drive thru was friendly except for one girl giving the food out with a red streak in her hair. She had a sour attitude for no reason.  We had ordered a CANIAC COMBO. Chicken was juicy and the crinkle fries were well fried as well albeit a little bit bland but they just went very well with the cane sauce which I always make sure to order extra of. I also ordered extra of the texas toast which is good but does not compare to the Raising Cane's texas toast I get in Texas. The cole slaw though was just ok, a bit too heavy on the mayo. The main issue of the meal is the fact that it's so pricy now for what you get.  All in all, food itself is great but price is unfortunately climbing up there.;7;4;9
/biz/snack-house-naperville-2;Snack House;Korean;Naperville, IL;Dec 28, 2023;4;Snack House was open for Christmas Day so my dad and I decided to try it out for take out. It is a small stall in the H-Mart food court. You go up to the cashier at the front and order. Afterwards, they give you a pager which tells you when your food is ready.  We ordered a tonkatsu cupbop. The sauce it comes with is not a traditional katsu sauce but it was tangy and sweet and went well with the rice bowl. The bowl was mostly rice but was quite hefty and I enjoyed the lettuce and the small veggie dishes on top.  All in all, a nice rice bowl option at H-Mart.;7;5;8

One of my friends and I shared: CLAM AND CHORIZO PASTA: Surprisingly great combination of proteins. The flavor and the texture of the pasta was wonderful. Really great dish!  WAGYU BURGER: Burger was cooked well and great combination of items on the burger! All in all, a solid restaurant option to hang out with friends.;7;4;6

We arrived at 7:30 PM and were seated right away even without a reservation. The restaurant was pretty empty and we were seated to the side and only one table near us was filled.  Our server was very friendly and got our order to us quickly.  I tried a MOCKTAIL which was nice and tasty.  We had a side of BRUSSEL SPROUTS. The sprouts were very tasty and cooked well. Definitely a nice starter.  I also had a CHOPPED SALAD. When I received the bowl though I noticed a fly crawling around the hard boiled egg :O That did turn my stomach a bit but the waitress did exchange the whole bowl for a new one. The flavor and combination of the salad was great. The egg though was overly boiled and had way too much paprika on them.  All in all, the food option was nice as was the service  however, there may be a slight cleanliness issue that may need to be addressed?;6;4;7

The food quality that was received felt very disappointing especially for the cost.;7;5;5

There weren't too many people in front of us waiting for food but because it seems like there was only one person working, service was quite slow.  I tried the PDX SAMPLER. I loved the variety of the birria items. The flavor was great and I love how the consome was served in a little coffee cup. The items were quite heavy so the sampler ended up being more items than I could eat in one seating.  I also ordered a HORCHATA which was delicious and help to cute down on some of the oiliness from the food.  All in all, a great option for birria around the area.;7;5;7
/biz/hons-wun-tun-house-san-francisco-3;Hon's Wun-Tun House;Cantonese,Noodles;Chinatown, San Francisco;Dec 20, 2023;4;I came here with a group of four on a Tuesday around 7 PM. The restaurant was moderately busy but we were seated right away at one of the booths.  We were able to order without much of a wait and the food came out quickly as well except for the pan fried potstickers towards the end of our meal. They apparently forgot about our order and they did not bring it over to us till we had asked three different people.  For our meal we shared:  SAUTÉED STRING BEANS: Beans were very well cooked. Flavor was good but a little bit on the saltier side.  XIAO LONG BAO: The meat was well seasoned and had a good amount of soup inside. The skin was just a little bit on the thicker side than  what I like.  PAN FRIED POTSTICKER: Meat was a bit too sweet for my taste. The bottom part was a lot more crispy than the rest of the dumpling and the texture was ok not my favorite.  SEAFOOD SOUP: Sound was a bit on the lighter side but went well with the red vinegar on the side.  All in all, pretty good food but service did drop towards the end of our meal.;7;4;8
/biz/the-eureka-inn-eureka-2;The Eureka Inn;Hotels;Eureka, CA;Dec 18, 2023;3;"My friend and I stayed here for one night on our way down the coast. The hotel is large but quite antiquated. There was a huge ""living room"" area in the lobby that they had decorated with a large tree so it made it feel cozy.  We checked in with a lady at the front and she was very friendly and allowed us to have a slightly later check out time which was nice.  The rooms were quite antiquated and did not have much. Additionally, the walls were paper thin so I could hear the next door quite clearly the whole night.  They provide a free breakfast which consisted of some pastries, toast, yogurt and drinks.  All in all, a large, older hotel with lots of history that holds both pros and cons.";7;4;7
/biz/los-tacos-no-1-new-york-12;Los Tacos No.1;Tacos;Chelsea, New York;Dec 18, 2023;4;I stopped by here on a Wednesday night around 9:30 PM with a friend. We were able to order right away with the cashier at the front.  The first thing that we noticed was that the prices seemed more expensive than the other Los Tacos we've been to around the city. Additionally, the cup we got for the horchata was also smaller than the cups we've gotten before from other locations.  We split a few tacos and the quality of the meats and ingredients were all wonderful and the taste was delicious. However, I am disappointed regarding the apparent increase in cost and decrease in size of items.  All in all, a new location that keeps it's quality but unfortunately pricier than other locations.;8;2;8
/biz/barnacle-bistro-gold-beach;Barnacle Bistro;American,Seafood,Burgers;Gold Beach, OR;Dec 18, 2023;3;"My friend and I stopped by here on a weekday afternoon to grab some food for takeout. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived and only had one other patron sitting there. The restaurant itself was a bit grimy looking but they were decorating the window for Christmas.  The waitress at the front was friendly and took our order quickly. After we paid, she gave us a beeper that let us know when our food was ready. We then went to picked it up from the take out window to the side of the restaurant.  Our food came out pretty quickly and we split two entrees: CRAB CAKES: The crab cakes were quite disappointing. They were completely burnt and all it just tasted like blackened butter. The ""slaw"" to the side was also of poor quality. (1/5) FISH AND CHIPS: The fish quality was nice and it was well fried  however, it was pretty bland. The tartar sauce it was served with did help. The fries on the other hand were so heavily covered with garlic that the smell was overpowering. It caused our car to smell like garlic during our whole road trip that day. (3/5) All in all, an ok establishment. Their take out window concept was my favorite part.";7;3;8
/biz/elite-experience-emergence-things-are-not-as-they-seem-new-york;Elite Experience: EMERGENCE Things Are Not As They Seem;Yelp Events;Hell's Kitchen, New York;Dec 14, 2023;4;Rating: 3.5 stars Thank you Yelp and Emergence for the opportunity of viewing the show!  Tickets were picked up at the box office. Their actual box office was closed so we went upstairs where they set up separate counters for the different shows. The counter for emergence was towards the back of the building. Picking up tickets was very easy and the person who helped us was very nice. They gave me two tickets, one for myself and another one for my friend.  She directed me to the merch table and I picked up a shirt and hoodie from there. Unfortunately, none of them were in my size and they no longer had tote bags.  Afterwards, we made our way to the theater and into our seats. We were sat in the orchestra section with all of the other Yelp elites and their guests.  I walked in without any idea about what I was going to see or hear. The show was a combination or spoken word explanations of scientific principals and questioning what being alive truly encompasses. There was Patrick in the lead, the backup singers, dancers and the musicians in the back. I really enjoyed the backup singers the most, their voices were strong and Patrick's voice was calming. However, the content of the show was not truly my cup of tea but I still liked the opportunity of experiencing it.  At the end of the show, everyone on stage lined up outside to pass out tulips to all the attendees and greet them personally which was very nice.  All in all, an interesting theater experience that I have never seen before.;6;3;6
/biz/magna-kubo-beaverton;Magna Kubo;Filipino,Seafood,Chicken Wings;Southwest Portland, Beaverton;Dec 12, 2023;4;I came here with a group of five on a Friday night for dinner. There are not many seats available since it is a smaller restaurant but we thankfully were able to grab a large table for our group as soon as we arrived.  You order at front with the cashier and they bring the food directly to your table. You also get all of your own utensils, plates, to go boxes, cups of water etc so there is not much service from the staff. However, everyone we interacted with was very friendly.  After we ordered, getting our food took quite a long time. However, the food tasted great and was well worth the wait.  We shared: LUMPIA: The lumpia was perfectly fried with great flavor. Definitely a nice appetizer.  MANOK (CHICKEN QUARTER): The chicken was perfectly cooked, juicy and was very tasty.  LIEMPO (CRISPY PORK): Pork also was nicely cooked and with great flavor. The crust was just a little too crunchy for me though.  BENG'S RIBS: Ribs had a wonderful fall off the bone meat. Sauce was good but a bit on the saltier side.  The sides it came with for the meals were also very delicious. I really liked the atchera which helped to cut down the heaviness from the meats. We also ordered garlic fried rice and it was so good. It was very well fried and so fragrant from the heavy taste of garlic.  All in all, though there were some hiccups, the food here is truly delicious. Definitely some place to go if you're craving Filipino food.;7;3;6
/biz/a-and-j-ichiban-eureka-2;A & J Ichiban;Japanese;Eureka, CA;Dec 12, 2023;2;Rating: 2.5 stars My friend and I stopped by for a quick take out in the middle of our road trip. After ordering, we were told that the food would take 20 minutes to be done so I waited in the car until it was. We had arrived around 12 PM on a Tuesday afternoon and the restaurant was pretty empty.  The restaurant decor is on the older side and seemed a little disorganized.  I got two lunch specials. Both came with either fried rice or white rice. The fried rice was ok. It was a little bland but did contain some small vegetable pieces. They also were served with miso soups. The miso soup was great, not too salty and held a great taste to cut down on the oil of certain items.  One lunch entree we ordered was the GRILLED GOLDEN FISH. The fish was pretty bland, not really seasoned and held a strong fishy taste to it. The egg it was covered in was pretty well cooked though.  We also got a PORK KATSU. The katsu was perfectly fried and flavored well. It came with katsu sauce as well which was tasty.  The lunch entrees were both served with a side of their golden miso sauce and one egg roll, salad and two fruit slices. The golden miso sauce was a nice accompaniment to different items in the special. The egg roll was a nice flavor and perfectly fried. The salad and fruit quality unfortunately was pretty questionable so I did not really touch it.  All in all, a quick lunch that unfortunately leaves much to be desired but does satisfy some cravings on certain items.;7;3;5
/biz/marufuku-ramen-san-francisco-5;Marufuku Ramen;Ramen;Japantown, San Francisco;Dec 12, 2023;5;Rating: 4.5 stars I came with a group of three on a Thursday night around 7 PM. One of my friends had arrived before us and was able to put down her name on the waitlist. She was quoted 20 min before we would be seated but the wait was actually pretty quick and we were seated around 10-15 min afterwards.  I ordered:  KARAAGE: Karaage was great. It was perfectly fried and flavorful. The mayo on the side really went well with the chicken. HAKATA TONKATSU DX: Ramen noodles were perfectly cooked. The broth was nice and rich. The bowl itself didn't look too big but it was pretty hefty. There were so many items and they were all such great additions to the bowl. I loved the braised pork belly. It was perfectly cooked and delicious. Definitely a great option.  Service throughout the meal was great. Everyone was so efficient and got our order and food out so quickly. My only issue with service is that they really rush you. They hustled us out as soon as we paid our check and did not let us chat much. I guess that makes sense how they can get through so many customers so quickly.  All in all, a great option for a quick, comforting bowl of ramen.;7;3;5
/biz/terrene-san-francisco-2;Terrene;Cocktail Bars;Financial District, San Francisco;Dec 12, 2023;4;I stayed here with a friend for one night and ended up eating lunch and breakfast in the restaurant and ordering dinner through room service from here because we had dining credits from our credit card.  Everyone who arrives in the restaurant orders at the cashier first and then they give you a number for the table that you bring to wherever you are sitting and they bring everything to you.  Service is efficient and food came out quickly.  For breakfast I had the CLASSIC ONE with a side of sourdough. The sourdough was amazing and the butter it came with was delicious. The potatoes on the side were perfectly fried as was the bacon. The eggs were ok though a bit bland. And the side of the greens could have been dressed a bit more as well.  I also sipped on some CHAI LATTE throughout the meal which was pretty light on the chai taste but was still tasty and creamy.  For lunch we shared: BABA GANOUSH: The baba ganoush was delicious and I loved the roasted eggplants it was topped with. The pita on the side would have been nice if it was warmed but was still a good side.  LEAK AND ONION JAM FLATBREAD: Yum! This is a must order. All of the toppings worked so well together and was just so delicious.  AHI TUNA BOWL: This received a mixed reaction from me but my friend enjoyed it. The quinoa was nice and the toppings were good. I was not a big fan of how the tuna was flavored though. However, they do give a large portion of avocado.  For dinner through room service we shared: MARINATED STEAK SKEWERS: The steak was very tender, perfectly cooked as and very flavorful. The chimichurri sauce it was topped with really complimented the dish. The roasted peppers were also delicious as well.  TUNA TARTAR: They used the same tuna as from lunch time but this flavoring was much better. Tuna from both dishes were very fresh. This dish also had some purred avocado on the side that really mixed well with the tuna and the thin sourdough slices it came with. Again their sourdough is perfect.  SPICY FINGERLING POTATOES: Such a big portion of potatoes! Taste was great and perfectly fried.  All in all, most of the items from Terrene were great and definitely a great option for those staying in the hotel.;6;3;5
/biz/dim-sum-bistro-san-francisco;Dim Sum Bistro;Dim Sum,Cantonese;Chinatown, San Francisco;Dec 11, 2023;4;My friend and I ordered door dash from here Sunday late morning time for brunch.  Food came at a reasonable time and had pretty good portions for the orders.  My favorite was their siu mai, turnip cake and corn dumpling. Those were all so flavorful and delicious.  The chive and shrimp dumplings unfortunately were not that good. Flavor was ok but the skins were too thick and oily.  We also ordered the wonton noodle soups. The broth was light and nice and the wontons were good but they did skimp on the amount of wontons they put in. The noodle quality was average to below average though but the Shanghai bok Choy on the side was a good addition.  All in all, a nice simple choice if you're craving some dim sum.;6;3;7
/biz/k-box-karaoke-san-francisco;K-BOX Karaoke;Karaoke;Japantown, San Francisco;Dec 10, 2023;3;"Rating: 3.5 stars  We came by at midnight ""Sunday morning"" with a group of four. We were able to  make a reservation online around 1 hour before our reservation time. In order to make the reservation online they take a $35 deposit (which they take off from your final check).  When we arrived, the establishment was pretty chaotic. They only had one person at the front desk taking care of everyone so he was running around all night and unfortunately that meant the check in process was quite disorganized and also quite slow. However, the guy at the front was still very friendly and kept a smile on his face which was very admirable.  We were told our room number a few minutes after our booked time and walked there ourselves. This was not too difficult since the store was quite small and was easily numbered. The same guy who was checking us in told us he would be by to teach us how to use the system. He did not come until around 20 min afterwards since he was so busy, by that time we had figured everything ourselves and did not need any explanations.  Our system broke down after around 20 min of usage. The selection computer just stopped working and then the tv also stopped and the sound system started blasting random music. Since they were so busy it took them a while to get to us to help restart the system. Thankfully though, they took off 20 minutes from our final time cost.  All in all, the system can be quite glitchy and the store itself seems pretty disorganized. However, private room karaoke is always a fun time with friends!";7;3;6
/biz/sushi-on-north-beach-san-francisco;Sushi On North Beach;Sushi Bars,Japanese,Desserts;Russian Hill, San Francisco;Dec 10, 2023;3;Rating: 3.5 stars We came here as a group of 7 on a Saturday night at 6:30 PM. We made a reservation beforehand so we were able to be seated right away even though all of our group was not there yet.  The restaurant has a bit of an antiquated appearance but was cozy.  We were able to order items off of their happy hour the first half hour we were there. The rolls that came out were ok, very rice heavy and the quality of the items was hit very impressive. A lot of the rolls also had lettuce in it which is an interesting choice. However, they came out very quickly.  We got an order of the croquettes which was quite oily and its flavor was light and nice though.  Their vegetable tempura had a nice assortment of items but the breading was not the best.  I also ordered a nabeyaki udon. The flavor of the broth was great. There was not the best assortment of items in the udon and the egg was topped in an interesting way.  Though the food was not the best, their service was amazing. Our server was so bubbly and friendly and really came by to take care of us throughout the meal.  All in all, though the food did not stand out, the service was truly stellar.;7;3;7
/biz/odd-otter-brewing-tacoma;Odd Otter Brewing;Breweries;Tacoma, WA;Dec 7, 2023;5;I stopped by on Saturday early afternoon with a friend and the brewery was pretty empty - the small counter was filled and only one other table was occupied.  I mostly stopped by because the otter mascot was too cute. My friend and I tried a pale ale which was light and refreshing.  All of the otter decoration were very cute and the bartender at the front was friendly. Also you can buy whatever glasses you want!  All in all, a nice stop with a great mascot.;8;4;8
/biz/mr-and-mrs-tea-house-san-francisco;Mr & Mrs Tea House;Desserts,Coffee & Tea,Bubble Tea;Inner Richmond, San Francisco;Dec 7, 2023;4;I came with a friend around 6 PM on a Wednesday night. The place is quite small with only a few seats at a bar available. Most of the other patrons brought their drinks to go.  I ordered a matcha fresh milk with cheese creama on top. The creama was delicious and went well with the drink. The matcha flavor was very light and was mostly creamy from the milk. It was quite tasty but probably not the best choice for the matcha obsessed folks since the flavor was pretty muted.  I also got an order of curly fries which were a great flavor and perfectly fried! All in all, a nice stop for a quick boba drink and snacks.;7;4;7
/biz/tasty-pot-san-francisco;Tasty Pot;Taiwanese,Bubble Tea,Hot Pot;Inner Richmond, San Francisco;Dec 7, 2023;4;Rating: 3.5 stars  I came with a group of five for dinner around 7 PM on a Wednesday night. The restaurant was fairly empty so we were seated right away.  You order with a QR code on the table and I chose the tomato hot soup. Food came out pretty quickly. The flavor of the tomato broth was great and they really top it with a bunch of meat and seafood. There were some vermicelli inside as well but unfortunately the Napa in my pot was not fully cooked and so it was pretty bitter. The flame below the pot also didn't seem to be on so I couldn't cook the extra vermicelli they gave me nor let the Napa cook for longer.  Service itself was average. The servers did not really come by to check in on you at all. But the man at the front of house was nice.  All in all, a nice restaurant to check out if you're looking for individual hot pot that is not AYCE but did bring about some hiccups.;6;3;5
/biz/elephants-on-cedar-hills-beaverton;Elephants on Cedar Hills;Delis,Salad,Coffee & Tea;Southwest Portland, Beaverton;Dec 1, 2023;4;I came here with a group of four at 12:30 PM on a Thursday afternoon. The indoors seating area was already fully packed but there were some tables outside that were still available.  You order at any of the register and they can bring it to your table. Everyone at the counter and register was friendly, they also allow you to try samples of any of the soups.  I ordered the ELEPHANT CURE soup which was very tasty and really warmed the body.  Additionally, I had the FISH TACO. The fish was not fried unfortunately and was a little bit dry but the combination of the veggies and salsa was nice and refreshing.  All in all, a nice lunch spot if you're ever in the area.;5;3;6
/biz/strings-ramen-aurora-aurora-2;Strings Ramen - Aurora;Ramen;Aurora, IL;Nov 30, 2023;3;Rating: 3.5 stars  My friend and I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon to grab a chicken karaage and fried gyoza to go.  We ordered at the front with the cashier who was friendly and efficient. We left for a bit and came back to grab our food.  The gyoza was fried well and the flavor was great. I was expecting a ponzu sauce but they put in a spicy mayo sauce instead which made it feel a bit too heavy.  The karaage was a bit bland and was not fried well so it was a bit dry as well. The spicy mayo sauce went better with the karaage.  All in all, though everything in the restaurant was efficient the food we ordered was pretty average. Maybe the ramen is better, we may try that next time.;6;3;6
/biz/taste-of-sichuan-beaverton-3;Taste of Sichuan;Szechuan,Seafood,Noodles;Beaverton, OR;Nov 30, 2023;4;Came here with a group of four at 5 PM on a Tuesday night.

All of the dishes we ordered were great and prices were fair.  All in all, a great dinner option.;5;3;6
/biz/best-baguette-beaverton;Best Baguette;Vietnamese,Sandwiches;Southwest Portland, Beaverton;Nov 30, 2023;5;Came here for a quick lunch with a friend. You order with the cashier and food came out very quickly.  I ordered a #1 Special Banh mih and it was so good. The baguette was fresh and the highlight was definitely the pate which was so creamy and really brought all the items together. The banh mih itself was also quite large in quantity.  All in all, a solid place to grab a nice lunch.;5;3;6
/biz/sullivans-steakhouse-naperville;Sullivan's Steakhouse;Steakhouses,Bars;Naperville, IL;Nov 27, 2023;3;Rating: 3.5 stars  I came here with a group of four at 12 PM on a Sunday. The restaurant was fairly empty, there was only one other table in the dinning area for the whole time we were eating but that may also be because it was snowing at that time.  The hostess who greeted us at the front of the restaurant was not very friendly unfortunately which left a bad first impression.  They started with water for us. We asked for warm water and the teacup they gave me was pretty dirty so I asked for a new cup which they wiped clean but it left a really bad aftertaste on the cup so not sure what kind of old cloth or rag they used to wipe it with. Needless to say I did not drink any water out of that cup after.  Our server was great throughout the meal. They also did switch out our plates throughout the meal which was nice  however, the guy who did it (not our usual server) left lots of oily finger prints all over the plate which was kinda gross.  To start we ordered: TABLESIDE BLT SALAD: Flavor was great and was well dressed and filled with ingredients. Definitely a nice starter option.  CRISPY SHANGHAI CALAMARI: Calamari was very well fried and a great flavor. The Thai sweet chili was an interesting choice of sauce but would have been better if it was on the side because it was a bit over dressed.  For my main I ordered a CRAB CAKE SANDWICH and a side of FRENCH ONION SOUP. The sandwich was nice, the crab cakes were perfect. I did wish the veggies it came with were in more of a tossed slaw style though. It just seemed like they threw some raw veggies together on the sandwich. The brioche bun it came on did tie everything together well though. Soft and warm toasted bun! The Parmesan fries it came with were delicious and perfectly fried! Additionally the cup of French onion soup it came with was huge! Great flavor and not too oily.    We also had some bread on the side. The bread was warm and the whipped butter it came with was delicious.  All in all, though there was some cleanliness issues throughout the meal other parts of it were nice and allowed us to have a nice lunch.;8;4;6
/biz/kura-revolving-sushi-bar-naperville-3;Kura Revolving Sushi Bar;Sushi Bars,Conveyor Belt Sushi;Naperville, IL;Nov 24, 2023;3;I was very excited to see a new Kura Revolving Sushi Bar opening up near our family's home since they're pretty out of the way from where I live in NYC. The only other time I've been to a Kura Sushi was in Taiwan so that is my standard of Kura Sushi at this point.  I arrived in a group of three around 5 PM. The restaurant was already starting to fill up but we were seated without a wait. The booths themselves were pretty small especially compared to the ones we sat in at Taiwan. The Taiwanese booths could have comfortably sat 3 or even four people on either side, these could only fit two. This may also be because the restaurant itself was pretty small and just felt very crowded.  For those who have never been, Kura has a typical revolving sushi train on the bottom track but the top track has ordered sushis from the iPad on the top of each table. The sushis that go around and the ordered ones are typically the same choices but if you don't see the choice you want it typically is easy to order it directly from the iPad. After you're done you throw the plates down a chute and they count the amount of plates you eat. After around 15 plates a capsule toy is sent down for you.  Fish quality itself was ok and pretty average. I did order an uni that was super bitter and not good quality though. We also ordered a bowl of udon which was ok, but pretty pricy for what you get.  Additionally, the waters are ordered through the iPad as well and a robot comes over and brings them to you. However, the first time we ordered our waters it never came through so we had to ask our server.  In terms of service though it was pretty sparse, they only came to check in on us and clean out some of the larger dishes a couple of times. They also forgot to set up any silverware or chopsticks for us when we started the meal.  All in all, compared to the great experience we had in Taiwan's Kura sushi this one was quite disappointing and needs some work on each component of the meal.;9;3;5
/biz/karaoke-city-new-york;Karaoke City;Karaoke,Venues & Event Spaces;Koreatown, New York;Oct 29, 2023;4;Rating: 3.5 stars  Karaoke City is huge so I'm usually always able to just walk in with a group of people without a reservation on peak times (IE Saturday nights).  They make you download an app to order songs and control the system.  The sound system is not the best and the staff are not the most friendly sometimes but it is a nice no frills karaoke place that you can just go to when you want to sing last minute.;9;5;7
/biz/chi-restaurant-and-bar-new-york;Chi Restaurant & Bar;Bars,Szechuan;Midtown West, New York;Oct 27, 2023;4;I came for a private event on a Thursday night. Our private event was in two of their private dinning rooms which was connected by opening up the wall between them. The table was ready much earlier than our start time of 7 PM but we still sat outside at the bar as we waited for the rest of our group to arrive.  I was impressed to see a large selection of mocktails on their menu. I ordered a Chi Dynasty at the recommendation of our server but the flavor was just ok and the appearance was not the most attractive.  We ordered a ton of dishes to share with our tables family style. Flavors of all were wonderful. The spicy dishes definitely held lots of heat but were still quite tasty. I also really enjoyed their soup, the pig intestine soup was so rich and delicious.  Service itself was also very attentive throughout the night.  All in all, a great dinning experience and I am looking forward to returning soon to try out even more dishes.;8;5;7
/biz/ramsays-kitchen-naperville;Ramsay's Kitchen;New American,Salad,Soup;Naperville, IL;Oct 24, 2023;4;I had a reservation for Monday at 4:45 PM for a group of four. I was concerned before we arrived due to the early time but it worked well as an early dinner.  As soon as we arrived,  we were taken to our seats. We were seated in a comfortable alcove with plush seats and an elegant long table.  Our server came over pretty quickly and took our drinks. I was happy to see that there were a couple mocktails on the menu. I ordered the LYCHEE COOLER which was nice but on the slightly too sweet side except for a slight bitter note from the lychee possibly.  Throughout the night, service was great. Our server was attentive but possibly due to our seating area it was occasionally a bit difficult to get his attention if we needed something but he always came to check up on us periodically so it did not end up to be an issue.  For our starters we tried:  WEDGE SALAD: A really large portion of lettuce covered with cheese and dressing. The thick cut bacon was delicious and the cherry tomatoes and pickled red onions were a great compliment to all the items as well.  TUNA TARTAR: The tuna was very fresh and came with a great choice of avocados. The flavor profile was a bit strange though especially with the side of sour cream. They also came with some deep fried wontons. There should have been more pieces though because there was not enough to go with the amount of tuna there was.  For our mains we tried:  BUTTERNUT TAGLIATELLE: The portion was very small. I didn't realize the purée was only on the bottom so the top of the dish was very bland and also unfortunately cold. The flavor of the purée was quite light but nice. However, I would skip this in the future.  BEEF WELLINGTON: The tenderloin was just like the name states, so tender. Flavor was light on the meat itself  however with the puff pastry and the other items itself it ended up being a bit on the saltier side. The mashed potatoes on the side though were so delicious.  STEAK FRITES: The steak was very tender  however, we had asked for our steak to be medium rare and instead they gave us closer to rare in the center cuts of steak. We asked to switch to truffle fries as our side and the flavors was great. Both sauces it came with were tasty but the spicy aioli had quite a kick to it.  We shared two sides as well  ROASTED HEIRLOOM CARROTS: Such tender carrots and flavor was great especially with the yogurt. The pieces of peanuts also gave it a nice crunch.  CRISPY BRUSSEL SPROUTS: Nice flavor and very well roasted sprouts.  For dessert we shared the VANILLA MASCARPONE CHEESECAKE which was so delicious and a must order. That lemon cream on the bottom was amazing.  All in all, a great dinner experience with comforting decor and wonderful service. Food was great but there were definitely some that deserved more of a spotlight than others.;7;5;7

The space was large and spacious with a good amount of seating. The first thing about the store that stood out was the amount of flies they had around. They were crawling all over the walls, signs and tables.  They took our orders quickly and got our drinks right away. Someone in my group ordered a chai latte which was literally steamed milk and had barely any spice to it. Another person got a black coffee which they said was not good at all.  Unfortunately, a disappointing experience.;8;5;6
/biz/braums-ice-cream-and-dairy-stores-plano-2;Braum's Ice Cream & Dairy Stores;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt,Breakfast & Brunch,American;Plano, TX;Oct 20, 2023;4;I came here for a quick lunch in a group of three. We had our order taken quickly at the cashier and got our food pretty fast as well.  I ordered a double quarter bacon cheeseburger and it was so good. It was a good quality burger and giant. We got a side of fries which were tasty and some chicken strips with a side of cream gravy. Everything went together very well.  Their soda machine was broken and spat out soda everywhere when used so only the iced tea was available which I'm not a big fan of.;7;4;6
/biz/starbucks-reserve-roastery-new-york-11;Starbucks Reserve Roastery;Coffee Roasteries;Meatpacking District, New York;Oct 20, 2023;3;Came here on a Sunday afternoon while waiting to hit up a pop up outside. It was completely packed with people. I ordered a croissant sandwich and hot matcha latte from the cashier and it took forever to get my items. I kept seeing people who ordered after me picking up their drink and food.  When I finally got my drink, the matcha was not blended properly, I got a bunch of clumps of matcha powder. The latte art on top was abysmal and looked questionable. Additionally, the sandwich was cold so I do not know why it took so long to put a sandwich on a plate.  A pretty disappointing experience.;7;4;6
/biz/uchi-houston;Uchi;Sushi Bars,Japanese;Montrose, Houston;Oct 20, 2023;4;Rating: 3.5 stars  I came with a group of five people on a Saturday night around 5 PM for dinner. Because we had made reservations before hand we were taken to our seats in a booth area right away. We settled for the omakase which meant they just keep bringing out different dishes for you to try. They give you a good collection of items to try out. Quality of the fish and seafood was very good. Some dishes were misses and had questionable combinations but there were some that were surprisingly nice. I enjoyed their simple makis rolls. Pretty good fusion restaurant.;7;4;7
/biz/ping-pod-new-york-4;Ping Pod;Venues & Event Spaces,Sports Clubs,Summer Camps;Kips Bay, New York;Oct 16, 2023;4;I stopped by here on a Tuesday evening around 7 PM with a friend. The way that PingPod works is that you sign up for a time slot online and once it gets to the time your phone will give you a virtual key that you can unlock the door and get in. Make sure you don't arrive too early or you will have to wait outside in the elements until the key turns on.  The space itself is very small (only has two tables) and a bathroom. However, it was very tidy even though there are no workers there. It is quite barebones  however, there is a small fridge that you can buy drinks from through your phone.  When you first get into the building, there are two screens next to each table that show your name and reservation time. The screen is where you can watch recorded replays, and keep track of scores. They provide you with a basket of balls, paddles to borrow as well as nets to pick up the balls that have been dropped.  Since we were there during peak time the cost per half hour was 15$ which is a little steep  however, you can bring more than 2 people in for the reservation so divided up among others is not too bad.  All in all, a fun, no frills location to play ping pong.;7;4;6
/biz/izakaya-mew-new-york-3;Izakaya MEW;Tapas Bars,Sushi Bars,Izakaya;Midtown West, New York;Oct 16, 2023;4;I've been to Izakaya Mew multiple times throughout the years. But the most recent visit was my first time there post COVID. The restaurant always gets so crowded, so quickly. So it's best to try to get there right at opening if possible.  For my latest meal, I put my name down for a group of five around 7 PM on a Sunday night. They estimated around a 35-45 min wait but thankfully we only ended up waiting around 30 minutes. After we received a text that said our table was ready they still ended up having us wait inside for a little over 5 minutes as they prepared the table for us.  Everything in the restaurant is quite chaotic since they are trying to get as many people in and out as possible. They get your food orders down and out to you so quickly which is a pro but it is hard to flag anyone down if you need service throughout the meal unfortunately.  The dishes I tried during the meal were: MEW SPECIAL ROLL: Great flavor! Good amount of salmon in the roll.  TUNA TARTARE DOME: Yummy and creamy  however, flavor was a bit light. Additionally, in the menu picture they had drizzled the sauce over the item but for the dome we received, they did not. More sauce over the top would have helped to make the flavor a bit better.  AGE TOFU: Great taste. And each piece of tofu is pretty big.  CHICKEN NANBAN: Great fried chicken and the egg salad on top was perfect. Very comforting dish.  KANI CREAM CROQUETTES: Nice flavor but quite heavy  GYU DON: The beef was super fatty and had great flavor that really paired well with the rice.  All in all, though service itself may be considered both a hit or miss  food wise most everything was great and allows for an enjoyable quick meal.;4;2;5
/biz/malecon-restaurant-new-york-2;Malecon Restaurant;Dominican;Washington Heights, New York;Oct 13, 2023;3;I came with a friend to get a to go order while we were in the area on a Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was completely packed when we arrived and seemed like seating would be difficult to find.  We waited for our to go orders to be taken and it took a very long time. However, as soon as we went up to the cashier and placed our order we received our food right away.  We ordered a lunch special of the BEEF STEW with YELLOW RICE. The beef stew flavor was pretty good but I was hoping it would have more liquid with it. Additionally, the beef was so dry. However, the veggies it was cooked with were tender and soaked up the flavor of the stew well. The rice and beans it came with were heavenly. So delicious. Some of the best rice and beans I have ever had.  We also ordered a WHOLE CHICKEN with yellow rice and a side of red beans. Again the rice and beans were fabulous - I wish I could eat those all the time. The chicken though seasoned well was also a little bit on the dry side which was disappointing. However, the portions of all the items were great and we were able to get multiple meals out of it.  Additionally, the salsa they give you with the meal was so good but I really wish they gave more than just three small containers.  All in all, flavor wise, everything was delicious especially the beans and rice  however, the meat items were quite dry unfortunately.;5;2;4
/biz/puttshack-houston-houston;Puttshack - Houston;Mini Golf,Bars,American;Downtown, Houston;Oct 12, 2023;3;My friend and I stopped by on a Friday night. The courses looked quite crowded when we went but it was only because the course was so small. There were many different sections but you're only allowed one small section unless you pay for more holes.  It was really cool to see the technology and the creativity of each hole but it went by very quickly.  After playing a round, my friend and I stopped by the bar area to grab some food and drinks.  We got a flatbread which was quite tasty.  We also ordered a cali chicken sandwich and the chicken was unfortunately so dry. However, the fries it came with were delicious.  Finally, we also tried their chorizo and cheese empanadas which were not good at all. I took one bite and spit it out. Definitely avoid these.  All in all, a location that allows for an average date night.;7;3;6
/biz/love-and-war-in-texas-plano-2;Love and War in Texas;Music Venues,Steakhouses,Seafood;Plano, TX;Oct 12, 2023;2;"Rating: 2.5 stars I came with a group of four for a musical fundraiser. We paid a cover of 15 dollars per person and we're allowed to sit in the covered ""outdoor"" seating area. We could choose any seat we wanted. The space was large and nice. They mostly had elevated tables and chairs which were on a slant and uncomfortable to sit on for long periods of time though.  Service was pretty abysmal. There was only two servers for the whole area and so it took forever to get food and drinks or even orders  stated.  We ordered WAGON WHEELS which was a fried pickle appetizer for the table. The fried pickles were nice and yummy and the Smokey ranch dressing was delicious. Portion size was also huge. Definitely a must order.  For my main I ordered the SHRIMP TEXANA. There was only a small handful of plump shrimp. Flavor was ok and they were very well cooked and juicy. They gave a huge scoop of pico on the side which was way more than was needed with the small amount of shrimp they gave.  The order came with one side so I ordered the steamed veggies and also mashed potatoes as an extra side. The mashed potatoes were yummy and came with a great cream gravy. The veggies unfortunately were very lacking and not good at all.  All in all, a disappointing night but at least there was a pro of lots of live music to enjoy while eating our food.";8;3;3
/biz/taco-delite-plano-5;Taco Delite;Mexican;Plano, TX;Oct 12, 2023;4;My friend and I went through the drive in service on a Monday afternoon for lunch. We had our order taken right away and we were given our food very quickly.  I ordered an enchilada combo plate which came with a choice of beef or chicken for two enchiladas. I chose one beef and one chicken with cheese sauce over both. The cheese sauce was very tasty. I prefer the beef because it was more flavored. The chicken unfortunately was just boiled unseasoned chicken but it was moist at least!  The rice and beans it came with were ok. Rice had a nice light flavor but the beans were a little too salty for me. Everything came together very well with the sour cream, guacamole and pico that it came with.  All in all, a cheap, no frills Tex mex fast food restaurant that can quickly satisfy any cheap tex Mex cravings you may have.;9;3;5
/biz/the-tamale-joint-houston;The Tamale Joint;Mexican;Oak Forest/Garden Oaks, Houston;Sep 5, 2023;3;Rating: 3.5 stars I came by Friday afternoon around 3 PM. There was two other customers in the restaurant when we stopped by. Space itself is very limited to dine in so best to plan on getting the food to go.  Service itself was super quick. We were able to order at the register and get our food piping hot around 5 minutes after we ordered.  We got the plato especial with three different tamales. The tamales were so delicious and perfectly cooked. The rice on the side though was fairly average and the refried beans were just not very good. They had a strange aftertaste. We also got a side of the elote en vaso. The elote seemed to be warmed canned corn laddled the corn into a cup and topped with mayo, cotija cheese and tajin. The corn was so watery. Flavor itself was fairly lacking and they were way too heavy handed with the mayo so the whole thing just ended up tasting like mayo which was disappointing.  I also got a side of horchata. The flavor of the horchata was way too sweet and just ok.  All in all, if you come just for the tamales it is truly a treat  however, their sides are not as good.;7;3;4
/biz/vatan-indian-vegetarian-new-york-2;Vatan Indian Vegetarian;Indian,Vegetarian;Kips Bay, New York;Sep 5, 2023;5;I've been meaning to try out Vatan for a while now after seeing it across social media. I came on a Monday night at 7 PM with a group of three. Reservations were very easy to make on Yelp.  We were seated in the bottom portion. For the tables they require you to take off your shoes to enter the seating area. The seats were wooden benches with some cushions on top and pretty comfortable. The decorations within the restaurant were beautiful and intricately decorated.  The restaurant serves all you can eat pre-fixe menu with items for appetizers, mains and desserts. Every item can be refilled as many times as you want. They give you as much time to each each course as you want and do not rush you at all.  The food was great! There were a few items I was not a big fan of but apart from that everything was lovely. So many selections to try out.  Service itself was also wonderful. Our server, Divisha, was very friendly and really helped to make the meal an enjoyable time.  All in all, a great experience. $45/person is very reasonable for all you get and I can't wait to come back soon.;8;4;7
/biz/musaafer-houston-3;Musaafer;Indian,Halal,Cocktail Bars;Galleria/Uptown, Houston;Aug 25, 2023;4;We stopped by at 6:30 PM on a Thursday night as a group of four. We made reservations ahead of time so we were seated right away as soon as we stepped up to the front and gave them our name.  As we were lead to our seats in the back of the restaurant, I could see how beautifully intricate the restaurant was decorated. The seats were very comfy  however, they were quite low to the ground.  Our server and assistant server came over pretty quickly and really took care of us throughout the meal. Service was great and they constantly changed our plates and utensils throughout the meal to make sure none of the flavors of each dish mixed together. My only complaint would be that food did take a bit to get to us between each item.  I started out with a mocktail. The N-A PASSION FRUIT BELLINI was delicious and refreshing.  For our starters we shared:  PAANI PRUI: Such a yummy dish with great presentation. I just wish there was more potatoes and chickpeas in each paani puri. The flight of liquid fillings it came with were also great. Tons of different flavor to choose from. My favorite was definitely the yogurt based one.  ONION RINGS PAKODA: This was my favorite appetizer. The flavor of the onion rings were scrumptious and they even came with a delicious mint chutney to add on top of it. The actual onion ring itself was pretty filling as well which was a plus. Finally, presentation was absolutely beautiful for this dish.  PANEER: I love paneer so I was very excited to try this dish. The paneer come prepared in two different ways but my favorite way was the paneer tikka and it was also nice and warm which was a plus.  GOAT AKHATI: The presentation once again was beautiful. The dumplings were good  but the best part was the stewed meat under the dumplings. The flavor was wonderful. They did add a random Swiss chard onto the dish which really didn't add much though except some color but the rest of the dish really worked well together.  For our mains we shared:  GOAN FISH CURRY: Nice, creamy curry - I was hoping there would be a bit more sweetness undertone to the curry though. The best part of the whole dish was the fish. It was so so tender and perfectly cooked. The natural fish oils in the filet were such a perfect accompaniment.  BEEF VINDALOO: I'm a big fan of vindaloos so I really wanted to try this dish. The items of the curry aren't really stewed in so they didn't bring along the flavor of the vindaloo. Additionally, the flavor was not what I was used to and not really my favorite. However, the large piece of filet was very flavorful and so tender. It was perfectly cooked.  For dessert I got the MANGO DOLLY. The dolly was shaped like a popsicle and it's flavor was yummy and created a great end to the meal. It also came with a carmelized fig leaf but it just tasted like leaf.  All in all, a superficially beautifully crafted meal  though there were some hiccups here and there with the actual composition of the dishes but still an enjoyable time.;7;3;5
/biz/buzz-and-bites-houston-4;Buzz & Bites;Coffee & Tea,Sandwiches,Breakfast & Brunch;Spring Branch, Houston;Aug 25, 2023;4;Stopped by here with with a friend on a Friday afternoon around 1 PM. The cafe was super crowded but thankfully we were able to grab a seat. You put your order in at the register first. They then give you your number and bring your items directly to you even as if you have a to go order. The employees at the register were very friendly. Additionally, you receive 10% off when you check in so make sure to check in to Yelp before you order!  We shared a MATCHA LATTE. I don't like ice cubes in my drinks so they were able to make it without ice. The matcha latte was a bit too sweet but the flavor was great and it was so creamy. My friend and I drank it so quickly!  Our other item, COWBOY BURGER, took longer to come out but the flavor was very good and it was topped with a beautiful brioche bun. The only complaint I would have about the burger itself was just that it was a tad dry but otherwise the flavor was great and I would not hesitate to order it again. The tater tots that accompany the burger were fresh out of the fryer and nice and crispy. Flavor was good but could have used just a touch more salt.  All in all, a great cafe with nice vibes. Definitely a great stop if you are interested in a quick bite and drink or a cafe to study in.;5;2;7
/biz/taquilos-galveston;Taquilo's;Mexican,Tex-Mex;Galveston, TX;Aug 25, 2023;4;Rating: 3.5 stars I came here with a group of four around 3 PM on a Wednesday afternoon. The restaurant was around half full and we were lead to a cozy booth right away.  We had two servers helping us that day, one who was working his first day and another experienced server. Both were so friendly and really took care of us throughout the meal. I was incredibly impressed with the service we were given throughout the meal.  As soon as we sat down, we were handed a heaping basket of warm, straight-out-of-the-fryer chips and fresh salsas. Everything was so good, our group breezed through three baskets of chips by meal's end.  We also ordered a QUESO to start with and it was so good. I've missed true Tex-mex Queso since NYC really cannot get it right.  For the mains we split a few dishes between the four of us:  -TAQUILO'S MIXED GRILL: I didn't try the chicken but that steak was so tender and flavorful. Additionally the heaping pile of onions on the bottom of the hot plate were so good and soaked up all of the flavor so well.  -POLLO POBLANO PLATE: I love a good stuffed poblano pepper dish. The poblano pepper was well roasted and stuffed to the brim with marinated chicken. The chicken was very flavorful but a bit on the drier side unfortunately. The refried beans I ordered with the dish were absolutely perfect. Sometimes refried beans have a strange aftertaste but not these. These beans were perfectly cooked and soft. Absolutely wonderful flavor and my favorite part of the meal haha. The rice was just a tad undercooked but the flavor was good.  - SHRIMP AND LOBSTER TACO: These are more of a pressed taco but flavor was just ok. Honestly, not my favorite and quite a small portion compared to the other dishes which were absolutely humongous.  All in all, though not every dish was amazing there were still some that really stood out and left a great impression. Finally, compliments must be given for the amazing customer service interactions - they really make you feel at home.;4;2;5
/biz/katies-seafood-house-galveston;Katie's Seafood House;Seafood;Galveston, TX;Aug 22, 2023;3;Rating: 3.5 stars  I came with a group of six on a Monday night. We came around 5:30 PM, since it was pretty early the restaurant was pretty empty. We had made a reservation to be on the safe side but it would not be necessary in the future if you decide to come early.  We asked to sit in their outdoor patio. Though it was very humid that day, they did have a large fan going to kept us pretty comfortable. The only issue was that fan was so loud so it did get distracting during the meal.  After we sat down, our server came over right away. Service itself was pretty good. Our food got to us pretty timely. However, our server did disappear for a long time during the meal so it was difficult to flag someone down if we needed something at that time.  We shared two appetizers:  -BAMA FISH AND SHRIMP DIP: The dip was ok. I do love cream cheese seafood dips but feel like a crusty bread on the side might have worked better than the tortilla chips they gave. The chips weren't the best quality. Additionally, I wished the dip would have come out a little hotter. However, flavor was ok. There were lots of chunks of pure cream cheese though- would have been better if it was blended more.  -FRIED GREEN TOMATOES: The tomatoes were delicious! I really enjoyed them. I was not the biggest fan of the grits though and would have liked the dish more if it was just a simple fried green tomatoes dish.  For dinner my friend and I split: -FISH & SHRIMP PLATTER: There was a lot going on in this dish. The fried shrimp was good and pretty big. Fries were well fried as well. The fish was good but a little bit on the dry side. The hush puppies were cornbread based and also slightly drier than I would have liked. It did come with a delicious side of Tartar sauce and a nice cocktail sauce for dipping. The small cup of coleslaw was a good accompaniment and a good break from the heavy flavor. However, I wish there was a bit more flavor to the slaw, it was a bit bland and the cabbage overpowered everything. Finally, the platter also came with a side of crab Mac n cheese. The Mac n cheese was pretty standard quality and flavor. The noodles had a bit more bite than I like with my Mac. I also wish the crab was actually incorporated into the dish instead of haphazardly thrown over it since there was no actual taste of crab with the Mac and cheese apart from when I ate the crab meat itself.  SIDE OF RICE AND BEANS: Beans were really good and also served with sausage! The rice though was very plain but at least it was well cooked.  All in all, a nice seafood option in Galveston but did not really provide anything that really stands out unfortunately.;7;2;3
/biz/rappahannock-oyster-bar-washington-4;Rappahannock Oyster Bar;Seafood,Wine Bars,Beer Bar;Washington, DC, DC;Aug 21, 2023;3;My friend and I stopped here while walking around the wharf on a Sunday afternoon.  It took them a while to come to the front to bring us to our seats. Additionally, service throughout the meal and getting our food also took a long time as well.  I started off with a mocktail which was very beautiful and delicious.  Afterwards, my friend and I ordered a small seafood tower. There were some items that were very delicious and others that were just ok.  All in all, an ok seafood option at the wharf.;7;3;6
/biz/dunkin-naperville;Dunkin';Donuts,Coffee & Tea;Naperville, IL;Aug 19, 2023;1;First time I've been to a fast food restaurant and literally had five employees walk by without acknowledgement while I'm just trying to order my food and get on with my day. It's awkward when the employees literally walk by, stare at you for a minute then turn around and walk away. Took about 5-10 minutes before the first employee I saw and ignored me finally walked to the cashier to take my order. What a mess.;6;4;5
/biz/miette-culinary-studio-new-york;Miette Culinary Studio;Cooking Classes,Venues & Event Spaces;Little Italy, New York;Aug 17, 2023;4;Went here for a private event that was held in the space. The entrance is unassuming and you get into the studio through a lift. The event was not an actual cooking class so I cannot comment on the classes itself but the space is large and spacious. There is a complete amount of utensils and all you need to host an event. Great place to host future events!;8;3;7

/biz/red-robin-gourmet-burgers-and-brews-warrenville;Red Robin Gourmet Burgers and Brews;American,Burgers;Warrenville, IL;Aug 17, 2023;3;It's been a very long time since I last dinned in at a Red Robin's but decided to since my father and I both had a free birthday burger and wanted to use it up.  We arrived around 1 PM on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant was very empty, there were only a few tables filled. The restaurant itself did not seem very updated and was kind of dark and sticky. My previous experiences eating at Red Robins has honored both me and my dad's free burgers on the same day but this restaurant would not which is disappointing since previous visits to this exact restaurant have allowed us to do that, so I'm not sure why they couldn't to this visit - so we definitely started our meal on a disappointed tone.  Service itself was a bit lacking especially in the beginning, it took a while for any server to come greet us when we sat down. No water was given, not greeting was spoken, we just kept seeing all of the different waiter walking around and ignoring us. When we finally got our order taken, food took a bit to get to us as well. Our server mostly came up to help us out towards the end of the meal only. However, she was very friendly when taking our order and towards the end of our meal as well.  I ordered a Bleu Ribbon Burger which was very yummy. The bun could have been toasted a bit more but the flavor was good. I also got a side of onion rings which were great especially with their onion rings sauce.  I had originally planned to drink just a normal water with my meal but the water had a strange after taste so I ordered a freckled lemonade which was a bit on the sweeter side but was quite good. All in all, a fairly disappointing experience compared to previous Red Robins visits I've had before.;8;3;7
/biz/pine-grove-resort-ephraim;Pine Grove Resort;Hotels;Ephraim, WI;Aug 17, 2023;2;Rating: 2.5 stars  My family came to stay here for 2 nights while we explored Door County. We went on Wednesday and left on a Friday.  When we first arrived Wednesday afternoon, the lady at the front desk was kind of rude, standoffish and didn't really want to answer any of our questions.  Walking through the hallway, everything looked very antiquated. When we got into our room I was disappointed to see that our over $350 a night room was pretty dilapidated, old and tiny. However, there was a small mini fridge and microwave available which was nice. There is free wifi available but can be fairly laggy.  The resort itself is located right across the street from the water so you get a nice view of the water and you do get a small balcony to sit on with some patio furniture  however, there always seemed to be so many mosquitos there so I never did go outside.   There is free breakfast available for guests. There were a few trays available for guests to bring their food up to their room. The selection was pretty simple but filling with some fruit, cereal and frozen jimmy jones breakfast sandwiches. There was a guy working in the breakfast room one morning that was kinda rude but apart from him and the lady at the front desk all of the other staff were quite friendly especially the housecleaning staff.  All in all, a fairly average accommodation that wasn't too impressive  however, if you're not planning on staying in your room for too long while exploring Door County it may be adequate.;7;4;5
/biz/lao-sze-chuan-aurora;Lao Sze Chuan;Chinese;Aurora, IL;Aug 16, 2023;4;"Grade: 3.5 stars  I came with a group of 5 people on a Saturday night around 5:30 or 6:00 PM. The restaurant was fairly empty so we got our choice of whatever kind of seats we wanted.  We were taken to our seats personally by the manager and another server. The manger herself was very responsive and helpful throughout the meal. Service itself was very fast and we got our food quickly as well.  For food, we had two people in our group who could not eat spicy foods so we ordered all of the non spicy options. Except for the dan dan noodles which could only be changed down to mild spicy.  We shared: -SZECHUAN STRING BEANS: Great flavor and well cooked beans. Definitely a good dish to grab. -SEAFOOD COMBINATION WITH TOFU IN CASSEROLE: Nice combination of various seafoods, veggies and tofu. Sauce was great and went well with rice.  -SCALLION PANCAKE: I love scallion pancakes so was excited to try but these were a bit disappointing. There was a lot of oil but it was not crispy enough, additional the flavor was not all there.  -DAN DAN NOODLES: Even as a ""mild spicy"" option the peppercorn did have a bit of a kick. The sauce was nice but it was a bit more oily. I just wish there was a bit more pea sprouts it came with.  -FRIED FISH FILLETS: Nice flavor and well fried fish  -SLICED PORK, DRY BEAN CURD WITH CHIVES: Good flavor but also a bit on the oilier side. However, everything was cooked well.  All in all, a nice option for Szhechuan food in the area, just wish it wasn't so oily for certain dishes.";5;3;6
/biz/the-press-club-grill-new-york-2;The Press Club Grill;New American,Steakhouses,Seafood;Koreatown, New York;Aug 15, 2023;3;My friend and I stopped by at 6:30 PM on a Monday for restaurant week. We had been interested in stopping by since it first opened since we live nearby and it holds such high ratings.  I saw online that the booths looked very nice and cozy so we made a request for a booth when we made our reservation which they were very kind to honor. It was definitely a great seat so I would recommend those who try out the restaurant to get a booth seat as well. However, there was some trash under our seat when we were sat down though.  We started out with drinks. I ordered an egg cream which was chocolate flavored. It was a bit too sweet for me but it was still delicious.  For our first course we shared: -BEEF TARTARE: The flavor was good. Presentation was beautiful but I typically like beef tartare with bread or a substantial cracker though.  -HEIRLOOM TOMATO CAPRESE: Great appetizer option. Good flavor and fresh tasting.  -BUFFALO CARROTS: The flavor was a bit too strong and overwhelming . It might have been better if the carrots weren't completely fried. The blue cheese sauce was also a bit too heavy for me. However, the presentation was beautiful.  -BREAD: The bread was nice and warm. It was straight out of the oven. The butter it came out with was delicious and displayed in a beautiful manner. However, it was a bit hefty of a cost for a typical single order of bread.  For the second course, we tried:  -FLUKE OREGANATA: This was a great choice. The flavor of everything was great and the fish was well cooked.  -RAVIOLI STROGANOFF: I really wanted to like this dish since the ravioli's flavor was wonderful and I liked the soup it came in. However, the mushrooms overlying the ravioli were a bit too acidic and also the ravioli itself was undercooked. The edges of every ravioli was so hard almost like it was completely uncooked.  Finally for dessert we got:  -APRICOT POPSICLE: Definitely a must order. All of the servers told us to get this. Flavor was wonderful and everything worked so well.  -CHOCOLATE 7 LAYER CAKE: Average chocolate cake and the cake portion was a bit dry unfortunately.  Our server was very friendly  however, service itself was so slow. There was not that many people in the restaurant but food still took around 40 minutes to get to us. Additionally, we had ordered bread but they never brought it to us until we asked again. After we got all the food, waiting for our check and also getting our card back took even more time.  All in all, though there were many positive points of this establishment there were also some points it was lacking. Hopefully they'll be able to fix some of those areas in the future!;5;3;6
/biz/chefs-hat-ephraim;Chef's Hat;New American,Breakfast & Brunch,Burgers;Ephraim, WI;Aug 15, 2023;3;My parents and I ended up ordering take out from Chef's Hat two nights in a row during our vacation because there was not many other dinner options in the area within walking distance of our resort.  Their take out option is pretty efficient. You call and make the appointment and food is given a 20 minute time line but you can likely pick it up earlier than that.  We tried many items during our two meals listed below:  -TURKEY BLT: Sandwich has a nice amount of components and the bread was nice  however, it was way too dry. Needs a better amount of sauces if comes with. Additionally, it was sloppily put together so it felt like half of the items were coming out when I picked up the sandwich to take a bite of it.  -POTATO SALAD: ok flavor a bit overly acidic though  -TOMATO BISQUE: A great soup taste! Simple but robust. Went well with the turkey BLT and helped to make it not taste as dry.  --LEMON PEPPER SHEIMP TACO: The tacos were pretty dry as well - not enough sauce on them. The shrimp was well cooked and flavored though. Additionally, the chips they came with were pretty small in quantity and also sadly pretty stale. The small container of salsa on the side was ok and tied it together.  --APPETIZER SAMPLER: The olive oil bread points that came with the spinach and artichoke Parmesan was so good in addition to the spinach and artichoke Parmesan itself. The bruschetta was pretty disappointing it had the flavor down but was too summer squash forward instead of tomato. The stuffed shrimp was delicious and well cooked. However, the stuffed peppadews were just ok. Additionally, they liked to over dress the whole dish with microgreens which was really unnecessary.  All prices for the dishes are pretty inflated for what you get but I guess that's what happens in a touristy area during peak season.  All in all, an average meal option but nothing too impressive.;8;3;6
/biz/big-easy-bagel-and-beignet-egg-harbor;Big Easy Bagel And Beignet;Bagels,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch;Egg Harbor, WI;Aug 15, 2023;4;My parents and I stopped by around 12 PM on a Thursday afternoon. The restaurant was fairly empty so we had a lot of space to sit down.  You put your order with the cashier up front and then they bring everything to you once the food is ready. Food came out pretty quickly.  Service itself was great as well. Everyone throughout the shop was very friendly.  I ordered a WILDBERRY ACAI WITH LEMONADE and the flavor was good but it was a bit too sweet for me.  For my main, I got a TATER TOT SCRAMBLE. The tater tot was well fried and had a great flavor. The gravy was a surprising addition but it did really bring the rest of the items of bacon, cheese and eggs together well. The scrambled eggs were nice and soft. Additionally, portion size was big it ended up being enough for me for two meals.   All in all, a great brunch option in the area!;7;3;6
/biz/ixta-cocina-mexicana-mezcal-bar-new-york;IXTA Cocina Mexicana + Mezcal Bar;Mexican;NoHo, New York;Jan 6, 2024;4;Came here with two buddies and had a great dinner. We started with the chips and guac and the ceviche. We then each got two tacos and shared the duck confit. Everything was delicious. I probably preferred the duck confit without the tortilla as the tortilla mashed the amazing flavor. The fish taco was amazing and could go toe to toe with any fish taco in Southern California. The ambiance was trendy but not too sceney. Service was a bit slow given they weren't very busy;--;--;--
/biz/crema-gourmet-espresso-bar-brickell-miami;Crema Gourmet Espresso Bar - Brickell;Breakfast & Brunch,Coffee & Tea,Juice Bars & Smoothies;Brickell, Miami;Dec 31, 2023;4;I usually hate breakfast places with long lines. I can't understand who ever wants to wait for 45 minutes for French toast. Fortunately this line moves quickly and the food comes out quickly. The one exception was this one women who had a shockingly consultative session with the cashier and then took a phone call. Weirdly the drinks come out kind of slowly;--;--;--

We were not disappointed. Everything was delicious - my favorite was the lamb and the mushrooms. I only ordered one cocktail and would have ordered another but the waiter didn't ask - in the morning I was glad about it. The space was big and not much of a wait, although it was busy. Would definitely come back;--;--;--

/biz/manhatta-new-york;Manhatta;New American;Financial District, New York;Dec 16, 2023;5;Awesome views. Came here for a holiday party.

/biz/win-son-bakery-brooklyn-9;Win Son Bakery;Taiwanese,Cocktail Bars,Sandwiches;East Williamsburg, Brooklyn;Dec 9, 2023;5;I'll start by saying I'm not cool enough to come here. Everyone that works here is a caricature of Brooklyn, nose rings, died hair, tattoos are a must. I, a guy who wears button downs and lives in midtown, felt like a bit of a tourist.  That said, everything here is damn good. Would love to come back. The plant daddy was a good drink.;--;--;--

/biz/tamarind-new-york-4;Tamarind;Indian;TriBeCa, New York;Nov 16, 2023;5;With high ceilings, staff rushing around attentively, white table clothes, and chandeliers - you know you are somewhere nice as soon as you enter. The service was slower than I think my friends would have preferred, but this might have been because they were stalling for me, who showed up 20 minutes late. Everything we ate was delicious;--;--;--
/biz/umbria-boston;Umbria;Italian,Steakhouses,Bars;North End, Boston;Nov 14, 2023;4;Great spot! I should have gotten the steak. I had the lamb shank which just wasn't that good.

/biz/pranakhon-thai-restaurant-new-york-2;Pranakhon Thai Restaurant;Thai,Salad,Noodles;Greenwich Village, New York;Nov 9, 2023;5;One of my favorite aspects of a New York restaurant or bar is when you feel like you are transported to an entirely new world as soon as you enter the doors.  This restaurant brings you to Thailand, and you feel it as soon as you sit down. The food was incredible- my favorites were probably the crab fried rice and the green curry we got. Service was a bit a slow, but the kitchen was fast and the restaurant was very busy;--;--;--
/biz/point-seven-new-york;Point Seven;Seafood,American,Cocktail Bars;Midtown East, New York;Nov 9, 2023;5;Came here today for lunch with two colleagues. We had a late launch - 130ish so the spot wasn't very busy. The menu is great - I had the avacado salad which was healthy and delicious.

/biz/via-carota-new-york-city;Via Carota;Italian;West Village, New York City;Oct 22, 2023;5;Awesome spot! Every single dish was amazing. We didn't necessarily order everything I wanted, since the girl I was with eats much healthier than I do, but we got the Brussels sprouts, artichoke, pappardelle, and branzino. Everything was great. There are lot of great Italian restaurants in the city but this spot stands out as 1) girls really want to come here because Taylor Swift once ate here and 2) the ambiance, really cool setting;1;1;1

The highlights were the Puesto Margarita (not strong, but delicious), the Pozole taco, the short rib taco and the chef's salsa bar. The guacamole was fine, but not earth-shattering. Same with the mushroom taco.  Fun atmosphere. Great service. We ate on the patio. Puesto offers a great blend of fun ambiance, fantastic food, and outstanding service. It's a must-visit for anyone looking to enjoy a unique and flavorful Mexican dining experience. Whether you're a local or just passing through, make sure to add Puesto La Jolla to your list.;--;--;--
/biz/kakawa-coffee-san-diego-2;Kakawa Coffee;Coffee & Tea;Point Loma, San Diego;Dec 17, 2023;1;My wife and I were staying in Point Loma, so we stopped by Kakawa Coffee for a drip coffee and a latte.  I've been to enough coffee shops to almost immediately tell the quality of the coffee from the moment I walk in. There are small tells: the syrup brand, the smell, and the way the espresso machine is maintained. When I walked in, I immediately felt this coffee was not 4.7 stars (maybe 3 stars if I'm being generous), but who am I to argue with nearly 200 reviews? So, we ordered a coffee and a latte.  I should have trusted my gut.  The drip coffee was drinkable (not great), but the latte was awful. There was no art or care in the quality of the shot or really anything else. My wife had to throw it out (I'm not sure she's ever done that before).  The service was fast, but with a latte, that's often a bad sign. If they're handing you a latte in under a minute, that's not what you want to see. The best lattes take a few minutes to get the right amount of beans, pull a shot, and steam the milk. You don't want to rush the process. We didn't try the nitro cold brew or any of the cold drinks, maybe that's where they shine.;--;--;--

The sauce stood out -- excellent flavor.  For those on a gluten-free diet, their crust is a real treat  it's excellent and doesn't sacrifice flavor or texture.  It's great to find a pizza spot that gets both these elements right. The other dishes on the menu looked excellent, but we only tried the pizza and the caesar salad. The restaurant was cozy and the service was excellent.  I took my extended family (9 people) and they didn't have any trouble handling a crowd that size. I made a reservation on OpenTable and they had everything set-up and waiting. It's a good think I did, because the place filled up.;1;--;--
/biz/pera-mediterranean-brasserie-new-york;Pera Mediterranean Brasserie;Turkish,Mediterranean,Middle Eastern;Midtown East, New York;Nov 24, 2023;5;Our family's Thanksgiving experience at this restaurant was truly memorable. From the moment we stepped in, the high-quality of every dish stood out, many dishes like the cranberry sauce tasted homemade. We also had incredible service. The ambience of the space contributed greatly to our enjoyment, with tasteful decor and a welcoming atmosphere. However, the music was the only aspect that detracted from the experience, lacking a consistent theme and feeling somewhat disjointed from the setting. Despite this, the meal itself was a remarkable success, and we left with a sense of gratitude for a wonderful thanksgiving meal.;--;--;--

The interiors seemed dated, the room smelled like smoke, and there was a distinct musty aroma that lingered in the hallways. On the bright side, there was a decent view from my room and they allowed an early check-in, which I greatly appreciated. However, I encountered an amusing incident during my stay. I had read that the rooms came with mini-fridges. When I couldn't locate one in my room, I called the front desk for clarity. To my astonishment, I was informed that the mini-fridge was an ""available amenity"" at an additional cost of $50 per night! It was almost comical. In conclusion, I would not recommend staying here again.";--;--;--
/biz/pizza-cafe-la-los-angeles-3;Pizza Cafe LA;Pizza,Chicken Wings,New American;Silver Lake, Los Angeles;Jul 16, 2023;5;Our neighborhood has been graced with an extraordinary pizza establishment that unequivocally sets a new standard for gluten-free pizzas. Everything was of the highest standard, but this review will focus on their gf pizza.  Pizza Cafe LA sources its gluten-free flour directly from Italy, but it's not just the flour that makes the pizza dough wonderful -- it's the chefs skill that makes it shine.  It's a Detroit style pizza with a gluten-free crust that strikes an impeccable balance between a crisp exterior and a soft focaccia center. Far from being an afterthought, this base is proof that gluten-free doesn't mean flavor-free.  In fact you'd never know it was gluten free. Service is warm and welcoming, and the chef passion for his culinary craft is evident in his knowledge and enthusiasm. In short, this restaurant is a jewel in our neighborhood. It's not just the best gluten-free pizza you'll find locally--it may well be the best you'll find anywhere. Anyone seeking an incredibly delicious, and inclusive Italian pizza experience should not miss out on this delicious neighborhood pizza shop.;1;--;--
/biz/district-table-and-bar-stuart;District Table and Bar;New American,Chicken Shop,Bars;Stuart, FL;Dec 30, 2022;5;I recently visited the District Table with their beautiful patio, which was decorated with lights and southern charm. The atmosphere was really enjoyable and made for a great dining experience. The shrimp and grits were absolutely amazing - the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the grits were creamy and flavorful. But the real standout for me was the elote corn. It was so delicious and had the perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors. And to top it all off, we ended the meal with a slice of peanut butter pie. It was rich and creamy and the perfect way to end the meal. Overall, I had a fantastic dining experience with wonderful service. The patio was lovely and the food was top-notch. I highly recommend the  shrimp and grits and the elote corn, and don't forget to save room for dessert. Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the cocktails. Boozy and perfectly crafted.;--;--;--

The atmosphere of the shop was also a standout feature, with lots of bright natural light streaming in through the big windows. The bright and modern made it a comfortable and enjoyable place to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee.

The latte and mocha that I ordered were expertly crafted and tasted amazing. You could tell they used high quality ingredients.

The tortillas were fresh and the fillings were cooked to perfection. I particularly enjoyed the brisket breakfast taco, but all of the options were delicious. In addition to the amazing food, the atmosphere at Republic Cantina was fantastic. The Texas-themed decor added to the overall charm of the restaurant, and the Texas country music added an extra touch of fun to the experience. I would highly recommend Republic Cantina to anyone looking for a delicious breakfast tacos and a fun dining experience. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was welcoming and inviting. Whether you're a fan of breakfast tacos or just looking for a taste of Texas, you won't be disappointed by a visit to Republic Cantina.;--;--;3

/biz/a-le-tole-venezia;A Le Tole;Pizza,Italian;Venezia, VE;Oct 8, 2022;5;Sometimes words cannot fully convey how much you enjoyed a meal. This is one of those experiences. Some of the best gluten free pizza I've ever had (and I've tried a lot in the US and Europe). Absolutely delicious and high quality ingredients.  This restaurant is in a bit less crowded area, but it's highly worth the detour to try their pizza. I had the A Le Tore pizza. It's rich, but delicious. Honestly, it's almost hard to believe the crust was gluten free.  One note. They only have gluten free pizza, not pasta. Therefore we only tried the pizza and cannot comment on any other items.  They also have very reasonable prices.;--;--;--

But, I feel it deserves an honest review. The good:  Some of the best chilaquiles we've ever had! You can't go wrong with any of them. And we've chilaquiles at a lot of different restaurants. They are consistently delicious. The tacos were also quite good. And the beans are delicious.  The bad: The omelettes were incredibly bland. We had the Steak Fajita Omelette and the Chile Rellenos Omelette. Probably the blandest omelette of my life.  I'm not exaggerating. Severely under salted and no flavor.  The service was also quite slow. No refills on water and probably at least a 15 minute wait to get our check.  The gross: We found hairs in multiple dishes.;2;--;--
/biz/dunsmoor-los-angeles;Dunsmoor;American;Glassell Park, Los Angeles;Jul 9, 2022;5;One of the best meals I've had in years. Everything about this restaurant is perfect.

Also, the Coal Roasted Oysters, Mushroom Stuffed Trout and greens with pork where all beyond amazing. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. In addition to the incredible staff and great food -- the space is beautiful. Be sure to check out The Grant next door when you're in the neighborhood.;4;--;1
/biz/café-stella-los-angeles-2;Café Stella;French,Cocktail Bars,Breakfast & Brunch;Silver Lake, Los Angeles;Feb 3, 2022;5;I don't think I've ever seen a Yelp review be so wrong. Based on the reviews this place would appear to be a subpar restaurant for unsuspecting tourist. Instead it's an absolutely lovely restaurant with incredible food and great drinks. My wife and I (and our five year old daughter) had planned on going to another restaurant, but when we discovered it didn't have indoor seating we decided to take a chance on Cafe Stella and I'm glad we did. The ambiance at the restaurant was dreamy. The candle lit patio and jazz band made for a very relaxing evening. Had I stumbled into this restaurant on a side street in Paris I would have been quite happy.  The food was excellent. We had the fennel salad, the braised short rib and the salmon. Everything was flavorful, cooked perfectly and high quality.  We are already looking forward to our next meal there. As we were leaving my wife said if money was no object she'd have a standing reservation at Cafe Stella.  The only possible drawback could potentially be the prices for the entrées, but in our opinion it was worth every penny for the lovely evening.;--;--;--

We took our daughter to get a rapid medical COVID test. It should have been very routine visit. But, instead they kept trying to force us to visit another clinic because I asked if they could take my daughters temperature -- even though they had a medical staff. I asked them to please just do the test and I can get a thermostat at CVS.  But it gets even better. When they tried telling me to go to their other location they said I could get the same test there, but then the staff started disagreeing with each other about whether that was true. It was a mess.  But there's more. Then while filling out the patient form a staff member came out and told us we had to leave while they cleaned and we could come back later. So my toddler and I had to wait on the floor in a sketchy stairwell. All we needed was a quick swab. We were the only patients and they had tons of staff, but they refused to help us before cleaning. I had thought about using them for primary care, but their customer service was awful. One positive is the provider was great.;4;--;1

The coffee was delicious, the service was wonderful (and kind) and the food was high quality.I ordered the breakfast burrito (deconstructed at my request) and my wife ordered the Italian sausage breakfast. Both meals were delicious. It's also a great place for kids. Everyone was so kind to our daughter and she said it was the ""best breakfast spot ever.""  As others have said, it's a little pricey, but it's LA. If you want cheaper prices then LA probably isn't the best place for you.

/biz/the-sardine-factory-monterey;The Sardine Factory;Steakhouses,Seafood,American;Monterey, CA;Jul 6, 2021;3;The Sardine Factory has a lovely atmosphere and decent food, but the quality of the food does not match the price. Basically the Sardine Factory offers the quality of food you'd expect to find at a suburban steak house (in a shopping mall) -- at twice the price. For example, the mashed potatoes were not homemade and the cocktails tasted like a basic rail drink. Now, with that being said, it was a nice meal and a fun experience. If you're in the area and really hungry (plus you have the money) -- then go for it. I had Prime Rib and enjoyed it, but my spinach was luke warm.;--;--;--

Tommaso has all of those qualities. But, often, the food disappoints -- the restaurant simply survives on the history and charm. This is where Tommaso is very different-- the food is phenomenal.  Tommaso offers Italian-American comfort food -- done well. They had the best Lasagna and Caesar Salad I've ever had at a restaurant. The Stuffed Manicotti was also delicious. The only slight disappointment was the house wine -- but it was fine for a house wine. If you're looking for a great atmosphere and delicious Italian-American comfort food -- this is the place for you.;2;--;1

I had never been quoted this rate or given any indication I'd be charged a troubleshooting fee until I received the bill.  EM spent about four hours at our house and replaced 7 outlets for $345 plus a service fee of $59. That all felt very fair. The job was annoying and took some research to find out why the outlet were acting weird. I was happy to pay extra for the trouble -- but $500 without getting my approval is excessive.

/biz/stifel-bank-and-trust-saint-louis-3;Stifel Bank & Trust;Banks & Credit Unions;Saint Louis, MO;Jul 13, 2020;1;Stifel is nearly impossible to reach via phone and their customer service simply tries to get you off the phone. I have worked with a lot of banks in my life and this is some of the poorest customer service I've ever dealt with. After a very frustrating call trying to get the bank to refund escrow money they owe us, I finally asked to speak with a supervisor and the agent transferred me to a full mailbox and cut me off. Also, they are not accredited by the Better Business Bureau. Would strong advise against working with them.;--;1;--

/biz/overland-car-wash-and-detail-center-los-angeles;Overland Car Wash & Detail Center;Car Wash,Auto Detailing;Palms, Los Angeles;Sep 16, 2019;5;Best car wash I've ever had. Go before 10am on select days and it's only $16.95. Half the price of what I paid at another car wash and significantly better. I am so impressed with the staffs attention to detail.  One note. I'd suggest taking cash for a tip. I've never tipped at a car wash, but after seeing the detail of their staff I felt like I needed to.;--;--;--
/biz/homestate-los-angeles-8;HomeState;Tex-Mex,Breakfast & Brunch,Tacos;Playa Vista, Los Angeles;Sep 16, 2019;5;Literally one of my favorite restaurants ever. There is an attention to quality and detail at every level. The staff is friendly, the drinks are stiff and the tacos are delicious. I grew up in Texas and so it's nice to find a slice of home. But, honestly I like this place better than my favorite taco shop in Texas. I don't really have a specific recommendation. Everything is good. Try it all.  One note. There frozen margaritas are strong and very quality. No some syrupy sweet mixture.;--;--;--
/biz/republique-los-angeles-6;Republique;French,Breakfast & Brunch,Cocktail Bars;Hancock Park, Los Angeles;Sep 16, 2019;5;Wonderful and creative brunch. I had the pupusa with black beans and an egg. Surprisingly good. We also tried a couple of different pastries and loved them all. What impressed me most was what a family operation it was. Walter and Margarita where both working and their kids where even around. This speaks to the level of quality control and investment by the owners. Also, don't be scared off by the line. It moved quite quickly and it was easy to find a seat.;1;1;1
/biz/little-pearl-washington;Little Pearl;New American;Capitol Hill, Washington, DC;Aug 9, 2019;4;Little Pearl is a wonderful cafe near my house on Capitol Hill. The cafe is bright and modern and the outdoor patio is even better. The patio is very peaceful and given shade by a number of nearby trees.  During the day it's a coffee shop with food and at night it becomes a nice place to eat dinner. (Do yourself a favor and get the brisket burger for dinner.) It's owned by the same people behind Roses Luxury and Pineapple and Pearl. But, I always feel slightly reluctant to visit. Not because the food isn't delicious and the coffee isn't good, but because I feel the prices are higher than they should be and the food is never filling.  For example, I typically order the bacon frittata and an iced coffee (with oat milk). The meal costs over $13 and I always leave hungry. I guess that's the part that really bothers me.  I have to drink a protein shake before going to Little Pearl to help quench my hunger. And they also charge to use oat milk for creamer.  But, with the caveat of it being overpriced and under-filling, it's still one of my favorite spots in DC. The food is wonderful and the ambience is even better. Pick-up a potato donut next time you're there. You'll thank me.;1;--;1
/biz/lavagna-washington;Lavagna;Italian;Capitol Hill, Washington, DC;Aug 6, 2019;5;This has been my go to restaurant for years when I want a solid meal and a relaxing atmosphere. The menu isn't cutting edge and rarely changes, but you can be guaranteed a consistently delicious meal and some of the best service in the city.  I'm moving to Los Angeles and I'm going to miss this neighborhood spot. Do yourself a favor and visit right away! Also, Sunday and Tuesday they offer half price bottles of wine and their wine program is solid and reasonably priced.  My go to entrees are the pappardelle lamb and the rigatoni pesto with sausage. For an appetizer, I do the provolone salad. Also, the Bell and Evans chicken is salad. But honestly, there's really not a bad option on the menu.;1;--;--
/biz/langers-delicatessen-los-angeles-2;Langer's Delicatessen;Delis,Sandwiches;Westlake, Los Angeles;Aug 6, 2019;5;I'm a big fan of historic diners and delis, but so often they are living on their reputation and are phoning it in. That's not the case with Langer's. The food is amazing.  The staff was so friendly and made me feel welcome. But most impressive was that the owner was also behind the counter and has been for nearly 60 years.  He rarely misses a day of work and was actively engaged in making sure everyone had a great experience. I ordered the pastrami and highly recommend it.  Langer's has a parking lot nearby and offer free parking with validation..;1;--;1
/biz/amoos-restaurant-mclean;Amoo's Restaurant;Persian/Iranian;McLean, VA;Aug 6, 2019;5;This restaurant was amazing! It was unique and so flavorful.  Where do I begin? The staff and owner are so warm and friendly. I felt like I was a regular, even though it was my first time visiting. We ordered the saffron iced tea, chimichurri lamb and the Cornish hen. I highly recommend each of those items.;--;--;--

Apparently the owner will only allow her to notarize between 10-12 & 1-5. So frustrating. I was balancing my kid and a million other things. It's so hard to get there and park, but as she said, ""those are our rules."" I have done a ton of business here, but never again.";4;1;--
/biz/aris-diner-washington;Ari's Diner;Diners,Breakfast & Brunch,American;Ivy City, Washington, DC;Jul 6, 2018;1;Food is normally decent. Prices are fairly high for diner food, but nothing insane for DC. My main complaint is incredibly slow service. I went on a Friday and it took nearly 50 minutes for our family to get our food. There are only six booths in the entire restaurant and one person sitting at the counter. Nobody communicated with us what was taking so long. In addition, once the food arrived my wife's eggs tasted like something was seriously wrong with them and then she got violently ill about twenty minutes after we left. We won't be returning.;2;--;--
/biz/budget-stuart;Budget;Car Rental;Stuart, FL;Oct 26, 2017;1;"My sisters rented a car for me here and they wouldn't let me pick it up -- even though it was in my name. She had put it on her credit card when she made the reservation. She pre-paid it for me - I'm guessing that's the issue. I asked if we could just put it under my credit card and they said if we called and lied to the Budget corporate office it would be fine. They wanted us to say we'd failed the credit check. Why wouldn't you simply allow someone to change the credit card without lying to the Budget corporate office.  When we asked why they didn't inform us when we made the reservation the customer service agent said, ""it's in the terms & conditions.""  Any business that suggests lying to get around a policy should be avoided.";1;--;--

I'd been a member of Results, but cancelled my membership because of the decline.  The sales person at Sport&Health asked for my number in case we got ""disconnected"" but I declined. I hate getting hit up with multiple sales calls. Anyway, the day after I called, I got a spam text from the gym offering me a discount on the initiation fee.  Not cool. Please don't take my number from your caller ID and then spam me. If you call, be sure to block your number -- unless you're okay with unsolicited texts.";2;1;2
/biz/discount-ice-washington;Discount Ice;Ice Delivery;Langdon Park, Washington, DC;Dec 20, 2016;5;Great service and prices! Prompt delivery. We will definitely use again. Not much to say, besides the ice was delivered on schedule right to our front door. Way cheaper and easier than running to the grocery story.;1;--;--
/biz/roofers-union-washington;Roofers Union;Bars,Burgers,Sandwiches;Adams Morgan, Washington, DC;Dec 19, 2016;3;Had Sunday brunch here with some friends. Good service and a nice space, but subpar food. Ordered a burger medium-rare and it was was charred -- way past well done.  Three burger orders and everyone had the same experience. If I had a big group and needed last minute space I might go back, but that's about it. They did have a nice local cider.;1;--;--
/biz/ejf-real-estate-services-washington-3;EJF Real Estate Services;Property Management,Real Estate Services;U Street Corridor, Washington, DC;Aug 25, 2016;1;EJF is one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with. Our condo association uses them to manage our owners association and they have owed us money for months now. EJF keeps promising that a check will be sent or a check will be waiting at the front desk, but there's always a reason why it's not ready. This has been going on since May 2016 and it's now end of August. This isn't a low level front desk issue, but is a company wide issue of mismanagement and lack of accountability.;15;1;--

/biz/woodberry-kitchen-baltimore-5;Woodberry Kitchen;American;Woodberry, Baltimore;Nov 14, 2015;5;One of the best dining experiences I've had. I fell in love with this place from the moment I pulled up out front. It feels like you're stepping into another world.  The atmosphere and space are impressive. Probably the most impressive space restaurant I've been to.  I began the evening with a pre-prohibiton era old fashioned, pickled veggies and deviled eggs. All impressive, but especially the cocktail. Then, while waiting for the dinner to come out - the waiter suprised me with a gluten-free biscuit, since I have celiacs. Simply amazing. They had my loyalty at the first bite of the biscuit.  Then we had a couple of small plates. We had the crab pot, beet salad, beef ricotta dumplings (I couldn't eat) and lamb rib-eye. Everything was great except the lamb rib-eye. It was underwhelming, but everything else made up for it. Finally, we ended the evening with the C.M.P. and french pressed coffee.  Woodberry Kitchen does a wonderful job accommodating gluten-free customers. Thanks for a great evening Woodberry Kitchen!;1;--;--
/biz/jack-and-zach-food-baltimore;Jack and Zach Food;New American,Coffee & Tea,Breakfast & Brunch;Downtown, Baltimore;Nov 14, 2015;5;Jack and Zach's is a quaint diner run by two young hipsters. The food is fresh, local and organic. Also, phenomenal coffee.  I felt like I was stepping back in time to a simpler day. If I lived nearby, it be my usual spot. I ordered the omelet of the day with home fries. Very good - especially the home made sausage. The restaurant is small, only 12 seats total and all at the counter. No reservations. Service was fast and friendly, in spite of only two employees and a rush of people. I'm excited about coming back.  Nothing fancy. Just good food and friendly service. What more could you want.;2;--;1
/biz/the-helmand-baltimore-2;The Helmand;Afghan,Vegetarian,Middle Eastern;Mount Vernon, Baltimore;Nov 14, 2015;5;From the moment I walked in, I knew I was going to love this place. The atmosphere was warm and the staff friendly. We had a reservation and I'd recommend it, because by 7 the place was packed.  We started with the spinach and Kaddo Borwani (pumpkin with yogurt). So good. I don't remember our exact entree, but it was delicious as well.  We ended the evening with Turkish coffee and cardamom ice cream (with dates and figs mixed in). Do yourself a favor and try this wonderful Afghan restaurant!;--;--;--

/biz/his-grooming-washington-4;HIS Grooming;Barbers;Capitol Hill, Washington, DC;May 17, 2015;5;HIS Grooming Lounge is a neighborhood barbershop with a touch of class! I always look forward to my visits and know that I'm going to get the best service possible. A cut and shampoo (along with hot towel and beard trim, the standard package) run $40. Decent price for DC and cheap for the quality of the haircut. This is not a quick chop job, but a detailed haircut that's worth the money.  Pro Tip: Schedule Jared. All the barbers are great, but Jared goes above and beyond.;3;--;--
