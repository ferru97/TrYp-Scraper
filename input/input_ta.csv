We lingered over our aperitifs, looking at the menu and catching up. Our waiter was handsome and pleasant. The restaurant was  not crowded or noisy. It gets no better than that.  For her first course, my friend ordered the Mediterranean Salad; cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and Kalamata olives, beautifully presented, with a large block of creamy sheeps’ milk feta cheese on top.  I ordered the watermelon feta salad, here served with a basil dressing.  Squares of watermelon and feta are arranged in a geometric shape, the bright green dressing complementing the red and white of the salad. It was as pleasing to the eye as it was to the palate.

For her main course, my friend  chose the lamb chops; 5 little lamb chops, perfectly cooked, and served with roasted fingerling potatoes and bright red piquillo  peppers. She shared a lamb chop with me; it was divine.  And I shared my Signature Lamb Adana with her, a wonderful combination of ground lamb and spices.
