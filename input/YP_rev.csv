We needed a quiet table for two to have a romantic dinner and the host sat us next to a large group of a loud and obnoxious party of people and there were plenty of other seats he could've sat us in. He did it on purpose and when I asked him for a new table he walked away and ignored me. My girlfriend and I couldn't believe the disrespect of this man. He was a total pompous ass. As we were about to walk out, two NYPD officers came into the restaurant because the host called the cops because he's a little sissy boy. DONT EAT THERE!!! Avoid this place at all costs!!!

The chicken was super tender, the adana was perfectly seasoned and cooked and the lamb chops were the best I've had in a while.

The food:
I think the best part of the food is the fresh hot bread that comes out right after you've been seated. Get a few dips with it to make it even better - the smoked eggplant, and the spicy feta and red pepper are my favorite. But be careful with the bread....don't fill up, because you want to leave space for the actual food. And the food is definitely worth the effort of restraint with the bread.

The other mezzes are good too - here again, my favorites are the artichokes and the crispy phyllo rolls.

Another member of our party had the pan roasted citrus salmon and loved it, then the specific vegetarian dish, the Timblar, was also a successful dish.

To wash it down we tried the Fox Finger Lakes Chardonnay and it went well with everything.

I frantically searched for a restaurant that could accommodate that size while following all COVID guidelines during these trying times. I came across Pera while making reservations on Open Table. They required me to give a credit card which they would charge $25/pp if I cancelled without notifying them the night prior to the reservation, which was fine. When I arrived they followed covid guidelines perfectly with two separate tables of 6. Their menu was extensive and the food was great. Their drinks menu was also subperb (hoping to pictures to review later). Service was incredible with all staff being very friendly and professional. We ordered a variety of food including the octopus, lamb, salmon, and sirloin entrees. Everyone in the party raved about the deliciousness of the food. They also allowed me to bring a cake which they lit up and sang happy birthday for my wife. At exactly 10pm they ensured our food and drinks were off the table per the regulations, but were very polite about the whole situation. Of course by the end of the meal I was tipsy and did not notice the added tip for the party size. I ended up double tipping by accident. Upon seeing this the server returned later and specifically ask me if this is what I wanted to do. Although I did not leave the double tip, I gave them an extra one for the courtesy.

1,Pera Mediterranean Brasserie,Shira M.,16,2,2022-03-07 00:00:00,"I booked outdoor seating for a business lunch and had called the restaurant in advance to confirm that the outdoor dining setup was something my group would be comfortable with - there are several of us that are more cautious about covid than others (for various health reasons), looking for open-air dining, not an enclosed tent. When I called, I was told that the outdoor setup was open on one side for air flow. When we arrived, this was not the case - it was fully enclosed with plastic on all sides, except for a small doorway. After we ordered, I asked the waitress if they could roll up the plastic on one side to let air flow in (there were ties hanging down so it was clear that this was a possibility) - she said she would ask the manager and then just didn't come back until we were done with our meal. Having said that, my colleagues did enjoy the food very much, in spite of some being very uncomfortable. I just wish the staff had been more transparent about the setup and more responsive when we asked for them to make the adjustment. It was a 70 degree day today - there was no reason they couldn't have opened it up.

1,Pera Mediterranean Brasserie,Guilherme A.,48,4,2022-05-05 00:00:00,"How often can I say that I had lunch and dinner at the same place? Not often, but Pera is that kind of place in which having two meals in one day is a plus not a drag. 

I had to entertain two groups today and chose Pera as my destination of choice. I had been there a couple of times with different groups and had always had nothing but good things to say about it. 

The first group was a take out order. I have to say that the whole take out experience was somewhat stressful and that is why I am giving it 4 stars. Although the website points you to Seamless, they haven't resumed delivery service through Seamless yet and there is no indication  on the website about it. Seamless just says that the restaurant is ""closed.""  I was not sure if it was closed at the time I was trying to place my order or permanently closed. I called the number on the website numerous time until 10:30 am and no one would pick up the phone. I finally found an email on their website and got a response a couple of minutes later. Lesson: email don't call. After stressing about it the whole morning, I was able to order my take out order by phone. Crisis averted!! I had asked my party to choose what they wanted to eat from the online menu and having to choose a different restaurant would entail going through the whole selection process again. 

The food was well-package in individual boxes and labeled. 

Everyone love it! 

The seared salmon  with risoto and red peppercorns was out of this world!!!! Strongly recommended!!!

At night I went with a large group to the restaurant and the experience was, as usual, very pleasant. 

Serviced was a little rushed--I had to ask if there were any specials, which there was (baby lamb chops). And I am very glad I asked. The lamb chops  were incredible. I got four meaty lamb chops and by the end I was wondering where the full rack was!! I wanted it all!!

The grilled octopus appetizer is always a great option. You can't go wrong with it. The octopus is stubbornly tender and smoky. The white beans that go with it are packed with flavor. We also had the Chef's mixed mezze, a must have!

Desert was also quite an experience. The dark chocolate soufflé with pistachio (?) ice cream is a must!!!!!!

I love this place! 

My framework:
Can I cook it at home? Probably yes bc the food is not extra complex, but it is so good I would want to to try to replicate it at home. 
Can I make it better? Nope. They have nailed it. 
Does it tingle the brain? Check. 
Does it make me happy?

1,Pera Mediterranean Brasserie,Bill T.,1583,4,2022-09-29 00:00:00,"Came back here after a few years and have to say the food was just as excellent as I remember, if not better.   My husband (who is from Turkey) started a new job so we came here to celebrate and we couldn't have loved our food more.   Plus, we went to the Pera Palace Hotel for tea a couple of times when we were in Istanbul recently so we're pro-Pera!  To start, we had borek and a trio of dips to start and everything was delicious.   My cocktail, a smoked old fashioned, was phenomenal.  

For mains we had a fishcake and their take on steak frites.   Both were delicious.  The steak frites is thin sliced steak served kebab style (minus the skewer).   It was perfect.   For dessert, I had the lemon olive oil cake which was also great, especially with a scoop of ice cream.

I'd like to provide some constructive feedback to improve the experience overall.   The waiter asked if we wanted water and we ordered some sparkling water, which was brought promptly.   The next he came, he said ""are you ready to order?"".   That just seemed abrupt since he hadn't asked if we wanted anything other than water to drink or provided a drink menu.  I requested a drink menu as I knew they had some amazing specialty drinks so we waited for the menu and then ordered the drinks and our food.    This wouldn't be a big deal if I was at a diner and a lady with big hair and a note pad walked up to me and the first thing she said is ""whadda ya want?"" but when I'm dropping nearly $300 on dinner for two, can you at least offer me a drink?

The second thing that would help elevate the dining experience isn't a big deal but it's something that can differentiate a dining experience from a meal at Denny's.  When we'd finished our appetizers (the borek which had lots of sauce, plus the dips we had) our silverware was pretty dirty.  When they cleared our app plates, the guy put the dirty silver on the table and just took the plates.  

Are these little things causing an existential crisis for me? Absolutely not and I recognize they're first world problems but the point of the feedback is to help the restaurant live up to its promise.  You walk in and it looks very upscale and polished and then you have a couple of really simple service errors that creates some dissonance between the projected sophistication and the amateurish execution. 

I still give four stars because the food is amazing and I recognize that staffing in the service industry is tough but I think with a couple of tweaks, Pera can elevate its game.",18,Claimed,3,NY,1,0,128,NY21,1,1,1,0.0080969099422078,1,1,1,1,24.2631578947368,461,8,0.017353579175705,0.249457700650759,0.249457700650759,0.249457700650759,0,0,1,0.0021691973969631,77.37,7.2,0,0.0,1,0.0021691973969631,0,1,0,1,0,0.0,1,0,0,1,0.0021691973969631,1,0.0021691973969631,13,0.0281995661605206,27,0.0585683297180043,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,123,0.266811279826464,0,0.0,119,plate,"For flavorful Turkish food infused with contemporary influence, Pera serves to please.

Our 2nd drink was a mild jalapeño margarita,that our lovely bartender made & let us taste to wow us, AND IT WORKED.
I could've easily sat there with my kid for another hour, it was so cozy & pretty inside.
